  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {Quantitative perfusion MRI based on arterial spin labeling (ASL) is hampered by partial volume effects (PVEs), arising due to voxel signal cross-contamination between different compartments. To address this issue, several partial volume correction (PVC) methods have been presented. Most previous methods rely on segmentation of a high-resolution T1 -weighted morphological image volume that is coregistered to the low-resolution ASL data, making the result sensitive to errors in the segmentation and coregistration. In this work, we present a methodology for partial volume estimation and correction, using only low-resolution ASL data acquired with the QUASAR sequence. The methodology consists of a T1 -based segmentation method, with no spatial priors, and a modified PVC method based on linear regression. The presented approach thus avoids prior assumptions about the spatial distribution of brain compartments, while also avoiding coregistration between different image volumes. Simulations based on a digital phantom as well as in vivo measurements in 10 volunteers were used to assess the performance of the proposed segmentation approach. The simulation results indicated that QUASAR data can be used for robust partial volume estimation, and this was confirmed by the in vivo experiments. The proposed PVC method yielded probable perfusion maps, comparable to a reference method based on segmentation of a high-resolution morphological scan. Corrected gray matter (GM) perfusion was 47\% higher than uncorrected values, suggesting a significant amount of PVEs in the data. Whereas the reference method failed to completely eliminate the dependence of perfusion estimates on the volume fraction, the novel approach produced GM perfusion values independent of GM volume fraction. The intra-subject coefficient of variation of corrected perfusion values was lowest for the proposed PVC method. As shown in this work, low-resolution partial volume estimation in connection with ASL perfusion estimation is feasible, and provides a promising tool for decoupling perfusion and tissue volume.

In this review, we describe the major considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model.},

The displacement fields are modelled as linear combinations of basis-functions, which may be the discrete Cosine transform (DCT) or cubic B-splines placed on a regular grid. Regularisation of the field is based on membrane energy. At present the registration is based on a weighted sum of scaled sum-of-squared differences and me- brane energy. Great effort has been placed on the optimisation, and on providing computational tools to enable robust and rapid convergence even for relatively high resolution of the warps. The results that are presented are based on a multi-scale Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation. The registration is initialised and run to convergence with sub-sampled images, a field of low resolution and a high regularisation weight. The images and the fields from the first step are then up-sampled, the regularisation modified and it is again run to convergence. This is repeated until the required warp-resolution and level of regularisation is achieved. The method has been tested with promising results on T1-weighted structural images and on FA-images from DTI acqusitions.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in functional neuroimaging is to cope with individual variability in cortical structure and function. Most analyses of cortical function compensate for variability using affine or low-dimensional nonlinear volume-based registration (VBR) of individual subjects to an atlas, which does not explicitly take into account the geometry of cortical convolutions. A promising alternative is to use surface-based registration (SBR), which capitalizes on explicit surface representations of cortical folding patterns in individual subjects. In this study, we directly compare results from SBR and affine VBR in a study of working memory in healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia (SCZ). Each subject's structural scan was used for cortical surface reconstruction using the SureFit method. fMRI data were mapped directly onto individual cortical surface models, and each hemisphere was registered to the population-average PALS-B12 atlas using landmark-constrained SBR. The precision with which cortical sulci were aligned was much greater for SBR than VBR. SBR produced superior alignment precision across the entire cortex, and this benefit was greater in patients with schizophrenia. We demonstrate that spatial smoothing on the surface provides better resolution and signal preservation than a comparable degree of smoothing in the volume domain. Lastly, the statistical power of functional activation in the working memory task was greater for SBR than for VBR. These results indicate that SBR provides significant advantages over affine VBR when analyzing cortical fMRI activations. Furthermore, these improvements can be even greater in disorders that have associated structural abnormalities. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract Partial volume effects (PVE) are a consequence of limited spatial resolution in brain imaging. In arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, the problem is exacerbated by the nonlinear dependency of the ASL signal on magnetization contributions from each tissue within an imaged voxel. We have developed an algorithm that corrects for PVE in ASL imaging. The algorithm is based on a model that represents the voxel intensity as a weighted sum of pure tissue contribution, where the weighting coefficients are the tissue's fractional volume in the voxel. Using this algorithm, we were able to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF) for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) independently. The average voxelwise ratio of GM to WM CBF was ?3.2, in good agreement with reports in the literature. As proof of concept, data from PVE-corrected method were compared with those from the conventional, PVE-uncorrected method. As hypothesized, the two yielded similar CBF values for voxels containing {$>$}95\% GM and differed in proportion with the voxels' heterogeneity. More importantly, the GM CBF assessed with the PVE-corrected method was independent of the voxels' heterogeneity, implying that estimation of flow was unaffected by PVE. An example of application of this algorithm in motor-activation data is also given. Magn Reson Med, 2008. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Unlike in large sample approximations, the posteriors are generally non-Gaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. Predictive quantities are obtained analytically. The resulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, and its conver-guaranteed. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including mixture models and source separation.},

  abstract = {An open question in neuroimaging is how to develop anatomical brain atlases for the analy- sis of functional data. Here, we present a cortical parcellation model based on macroanatomical infor- mation and test its validity on visuomotor-related cortical functional networks. The parcellation model is based on a recently developed cortical parameterization method (Auzias et al., [2013]: IEEE Trans Med Imaging 32:873\textendash 887), called HIP-HOP. This method exploits a set of primary and secondary sulci to create an orthogonal coordinate system on the cortical surface. A natural parcellation scheme arises from the axes of the HIP-HOP model running along the fundus of selected sulci. The resulting parcel- lation scheme, called MarsAtlas, complies with dorsoventral/rostrocaudal direction fields and allows inter-subject matching. To test it for functional mapping, we analyzed a MEG dataset collected from human participants performing an arbitrary visuomotor mapping task. Single-trial high-gamma activ- ity, HGA (60\textendash 120 Hz), was estimated using spectral analysis and beamforming techniques at cortical areas arising from a Talairach atlas (i.e., Brodmann areas) and MarsAtlas. Using both atlases, we con- firmed that visuomotor associations involve an increase in HGA over the sensorimotor and fronto- parietal network, in addition to medial prefrontal areas. However, MarsAtlas provided: (1) crucial func- tional information along both the dorsolateral and rostrocaudal direction; (2) an increase in statistical significance. To conclude, our results suggest that the MarsAtlas is a valid anatomical atlas for func- tional mapping, and represents a potential anatomical framework for integration of functional data arising from multiple techniques such as MEG, intracranial EEG and fMRI.

Methods: In a simulation framework, 5-minute scan protocols with different scan time divisions between PCASL data acquisition and supporting measurements were evaluated in terms of CBF estimation variability across both noise and ground truth parameter realizations taken from the general population distribution. The entire simulation experiment was repeated for a single-post-labeling delay (PLD), multi-PLD, and free-lunch time-encoded (te-FL) PCASL acquisition strategy. Furthermore, a real data study was designed for preliminary validation. Results: For the considered population statistics, measuring the labeling efficiency and the blood (Formula presented.) proved beneficial in terms of CBF estimation variability for any distribution of the 5-minute scan time compared to only acquiring ASL data. Compared to single-PLD PCASL without support measurements as recommended in the consensus statement, a 26\%, 33\%, and 42\% reduction in relative CBF estimation variability was found for optimal combinations of supporting measurements with single-PLD, free-lunch, and multi-PLD PCASL data acquisition, respectively. The benefit of taking the individual variation of blood (Formula presented.) into account was also demonstrated in the real data experiment. Conclusions: Spending time to measure the labeling efficiency and the blood (Formula presented.) instead of acquiring more averages of the PCASL data proves to be advisable for robust CBF quantification in the general population.},

Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for simultaneous estimation of tracer-kinetic parameters and their uncertainty due to intrinsic characteristics of the tracer-kinetic model, with very low computation time. We train and use a neural network to estimate the approximate joint posterior distribution of tracer-kinetic parameters. Uncertainties are estimated for each voxel and are specific to the patient, exam, and lesion. We demonstrate the methods' ability to produce accurate tracer-kinetic maps. We compare predicted parameter ranges with uncertainties introduced by noise and by differences in post-processing in a digital reference object. The predicted parameter ranges correlate well with tracer-kinetic parameter ranges observed across different noise realizations and regression algorithms. We also demonstrate the value of this approach to differentiate significant from insignificant changes in brain tumor pharmacokinetics over time. This is achieved by enforcing consistency in resolving model singularities in the applied tracer-kinetic model.},

In this context, the capabilities of statistical machine learning methods is limited by the computing time rather than the sample size. A more precise analysis uncovers qualitatively different tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing performance for large-scale problems. In particular, second order stochastic gradient and averaged stochastic gradient are asymptotically efficient after a single pass on the training set.},

  abstract = {Background. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides the potential for a more comprehensive noninvasive assessment of organ structure and function than individual MRI measures, but has not previously been comprehensively evaluated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods. We performed multi-parametric renal MRI in persons with CKD (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 22, 61 6 24 years) who had a renal biopsy and measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR), and matched healthy volunteers (HV) (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 22, 61 6 25 years). Longitudinal relaxation time (T1), diffusion-weighted imaging, renal blood flow (phase contrast MRI), cortical perfusion (arterial spin labelling) and blood-oxygen-level-dependent relaxation rate (R2*) were evaluated. Results. MRI evidenced excellent reproducibility in CKD (coefficient of variation {$<$}10\%). Significant differences between CKD and HVs included cortical and corticomedullary difference (CMD) in T1, cortical and medullary apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), renal artery blood flow and cortical perfusion. MRI measures correlated with kidney function in a combined CKD and HV analysis: estimated GFR correlated with cortical T1 (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.68), T1 CMD (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.62), cortical (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.54) and medullary ADC (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.49), renal artery flow (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.78) and cortical perfusion (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.81); log urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) correlated with cortical T1 (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.61), T1 CMD (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.61), cortical (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.45) and medullary ADC (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.49), renal artery flow (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.72) and cortical perfusion (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.58). MRI measures (cortical T1 and ADC, T1 and ADC CMD, cortical perfusion) differed between low/high interstitial fibrosis groups at 30\textendash 40\% fibrosis threshold. Conclusion. Comprehensive multi-parametric MRI is reproducible and correlates well with available measures of renal function and pathology.

For quantitation of perfusion, both pulsed and continuous labeling methods potentially suffer from a number of systematic errors. In this study, a general kinetic model for the ASL signal is described that can be used to assess these errors. With appropriate assumptions, the general model reduces to models that have been used previously to analyze ASL data, but the general model also provides a way to analyze the errors that result if these assumptions are not accurate. The model was used for an initial assessment of systematic errors due to the effects of variable transit delays from the tagging band to the imaging voxel, the effects of capillary/tissue exchange of water on the relaxation of the tag, and the effects of incomplete water extraction. In preliminary experiments with a human subject, the model provided a good description of pulsed ASL data during a simple sensorimotor activation task.},

Materials and Methods CKD patients (n = 27) and healthy volunteers (n = 36) underwent renal 3T ASL magnetic resonance imaging, with inversion times from 1200 to 2000 msec for volunteers in the preliminary test, and 1800 to 2000 msec for volunteers and CKD patients in the formal experiments. The cortical RBFs were compared, and a correlation between RBF and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was evaluated. Results For healthy volunteers, RBF values increased with TIs from 1200 to 1600 msec, but were almost constant at TIs from 1600 to 2000 msec. The cortical RBF values of CKD patients were lower than that of healthy volunteers at TIs from 1800 to 2000 msec. In addition, the CKD patients had lower cortical RBF values than the healthy volunteers (P {$<$} 0.01 for both), and their RBF values positively correlated with eGFR.

  abstract = {In the field of neuroimaging reverse inferences can lead us to suppose the involvement of cognitive processes from certain patterns of brain activity. However, the same reasoning holds if we substitute ``brain activity'' with ``brain alteration'' and ``cognitive process'' with ``brain disorder.'' The fact that different brain disorders exhibit a high degree of overlap in their patterns of structural alterations makes forward inference-based analyses less suitable for identifying brain areas whose alteration is specific to a certain pathology. In the forward inference-based analyses, in fact, it is impossible to distinguish between areas that are altered by the majority of brain disorders and areas that are specifically affected by certain diseases. To address this issue and allow the identification of highly pathology-specific altered areas we used the Bayes' factor technique, which was employed, as a proof of concept, on voxel-based morphometry data of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. This technique allows to calculate the ratio between the likelihoods of two alternative hypotheses (in our case, that the alteration of the voxel is specific for the brain disorder under scrutiny or that the alteration is not specific). We then performed temporal simulations of the alterations' spread associated with different pathologies. The Bayes' factor values calculated on these simulated data were able to reveal that the areas, which are more specific to a certain disease, are also the ones to be early altered. This study puts forward a new analytical instrument capable of innovating the methodological approach to the investigation of brain pathology.},

Here a VB method for nonlinear forward models with Gaussian additive noise is presented. In the case of noninformative priors the parameter estimates obtained from this VB approach are identical to those found via nonlinear least squares. However, the advantage of the VB method lies in its Bayesian formulation, which permits prior information to be included in a hierarchical structure and measures of uncertainty for all parameter estimates to be obtained via the posterior distribution. Unlike other Bayesian methods VB is only approximate in comparison with the sampling method of MCMC. However, the VB method is found to be comparable and the assumptions made about the form of the posterior distribution reasonable. Practically, the VB approach is substantially faster than MCMC as fewer calculations are required. Some of the advantages of the fully Bayesian nature of the method are demonstrated through the extension of the noise model and the inclusion of automatic relevance determination (ARD) within the VB algorithm.},

Magn Reson Med 2008; 60:1362-1371), where PV estimates were used with a local linear regression to separate the GM and white matter ASL signal. Here a new PV correction method for multi-inversion time ASL is proposed that exploits PV estimates within a spatially regularized kinetic curve model analysis. The proposed method exploits both PV estimates and the different kinetics of the ASL signal arising from GM and white matter. The new correction method is shown, on both simulated and real data, to provide correction of GM CBF comparable to a linear regression approach, whilst preserving greater spatial detail in the CBF image. On real data corrected GM CBF values were found to be largely independent of GM PV, implying that the correction had been successful. Increases of mean GM CBF after correction of 69-80\% were observed.},

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between cognitive impairment and brain perfusion using arterial spin labelling (ASL) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing PD. Methods ESRD patients undergoing PD were recruited. Laboratory screening, neuropsychological tests and ASL magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were conducted prior to and after 6 months of PD. Age- and sex-matched normal subjects without ESRD served as the control group. Comparisons of regional CBF between ESRD patients before or after undergoing PD and normal controls were performed. Correlations between biochemical, neuropsychological and CBF data were also conducted to evaluate the relationships. Results ESRD patients showed poor performance in many of the neuropsychological tests; PD improved cognition in some domains. Pre-PD patients had higher mean CBF than post-PD patients and normal controls, but no significant difference was found between the normal controls and post-PD patients. Negative correlations were observed pre-PD (regional CBF in left hippocampus vs. perseverative responses, r = -0.662, p = 0.014), post-PD (mean CBF vs. haemoglobin level, r = -0.766, p = 0.002), and before and after PD (change in CBF in the left putamen vs. change in haematocrit percentage, r = -0.808, p = 0.001). Conclusion Before PD, ESRD patients had increased cerebral perfusion that was related to poorer executive function, especially in the left hippocampus. Post-PD patients performed better in some cognitive test domains than pre-PD patients. The degree of anaemia, i.e., haemoglobin level or haematocrit percentage, might predict cognitive impairment in PD patients.},

Validation of analysis techniques of in-vivo acquired images is complicated due to the lack of reference data ("ground truth"). Also, optimal selection of the MR imaging parameters is difficult due to the large parameter space. BrainWeb makes available to the neuroimaging community, on-line on WWW, a set of realistic simulated brain MR image volumes (Simulated Brain Database, SBD) that allows the above issues to be examined in a controlled, systematic way. Features The SBD was generated by varying specific imaging parameters in an MRI simulator, which starts from a digital phantom, and performs a realistic, first-principles modeling of the imaging process based on},

Although the algorithm must be evaluated on real data, a comprehensive validation requires the additional use of simulated data since it is impossible to establish ground truth with in vivo data. Experiments with simulated data permit controlled evaluation over a wide range of conditions (e.g., different levels of noise, contrast, intensity artefacts, or geometric distortion). Such considerations have become increasingly impor- tant with the rapid growth of neuroimaging, i.e., computational analysis of brain structure and function using brain scanning methods such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Since simple objects such as ellipsoids or parallelepipedes do not reflect the complexity of natural brain anatomy, we present the design and creation of a realistic, high-resolution, digital, volumetric phantom of the human brain. This three-dimensional digital brain phantom is made up of ten volumetric data sets that define the spatial distribution for different tissues (e.g., grey matter, white matter, muscle, skin, etc.), where voxel intensity is proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. The digital brain phantom can be used to simulate tomographic images of the head. Since the contribution of each tissue type to each voxel in the brain phantom is known, it can be used as the gold standard to test analysis algorithms such as classification procedures which seek to identify the tissue ``type'' of each image voxel. Furthermore, since the same anatomical phantom may be used to drive simulators for different modalities, it is the ideal tool to test intermodality registration algorithms. The brain phantom and simulated MR images have been made publicly available on the Internet (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb).},

Here we report the use of 1H NMR imaging to generate perfusion maps in the rat brain at 4.7 T. Blood water flowing to the brain is saturated in the neck region with a sliceselective saturation imaging sequence, creating an endogenous tracer in the form of proximally saturated spins. Because proton T1 times are relatively long, particularly at high field strengths, saturated spins exchange with bulk water in the brain and a steady state is created where the regional concentration of saturated spins is determined by the regional blood flow and regional T1. Distal saturation applied equidistantly outside the brain serves as a control for effects of the saturation pulses. Average cerebral blood flow in normocapnic rat brain under halothane anesthesia was determined to be 105 {$\pm$} 16 cc. 100 g?1. min?1 (mean {$\pm$} SEM, n = 3), in good agreement with values reported in the literature, and was sensitive to increases in arterial pCO2. This technique allows regional perfusion maps to be measured noninvasively, with the resolution of 1H MRI, and should be readily applicable to human studies. ? 1992 Academic Press, Inc.},

Visually responsive areas homologous to the middle temporal/medial superior temporal area complex and unidentified parietal visual areas were also observed.

  abstract = {Both normal ageing and neurodegenerative diseases cause morphological changes to the brain. Age-related brain changes are subtle, nonlinear, and spatially and temporally heterogenous, both within a subject and across a population. Machine learning models are particularly suited to capture these patterns and can produce a model that is sensitive to changes of interest, despite the large variety in healthy brain appearance. In this paper, the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the rich UK Biobank dataset, the largest database currently available, are harnessed to address the problem of predicting brain age. We developed a 3D CNN architecture to predict chronological age, using a training dataset of 12,802 T1-weighted MRI images and a further 6,885 images for testing. The proposed method shows competitive performance on age prediction, but, most importantly, the CNN prediction errors {$\Delta$}BrainAge=AgePredicted-AgeTrue correlated significantly with many clinical measurements from the UK Biobank in the female and male groups. In addition, having used images from only one imaging modality in this experiment, we examined the relationship between {$\Delta$}BrainAge and the image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from all other imaging modalities in the UK Biobank, showing correlations consistent with known patterns of ageing. Furthermore, we show that the use of nonlinearly registered images to train CNNs can lead to the network being driven by artefacts of the registration process and missing subtle indicators of ageing, limiting the clinical relevance. Due to the longitudinal aspect of the UK Biobank study, in the future it will be possible to explore whether the {$\Delta$}BrainAge from models such as this network were predictive of any health outcomes.},

This problem occurs in computer graphics where meshes with pyramids, prisms or hexahedra must be subdivided into tetrahedra to use efficient algorithms for volume rendering, iso-contouring and particle advection. Another application is for the use of some tetrahedral finite element solvers on a non tetrahedral mesh, or even an hybrid mesh. Arbitrary splitting of quadrilateral faces into two triangles has two major drawbacks: it can lead to discontinuities across element faces, resulting in non conformal meshes, and the subdivision of some elements into tetrahedra may need to introduce new vertices. The algorithms presented in this paper split each quadrilateral face of pyramids, prisms and hexahedra in a consistent way that preserves the conformity of the mesh. Elements are subdivided into tetrahedra without introducing new vertices. The algorithms are fast, generic, robust, and local, i.e. they do not need any neighboring information}

  abstract = {We investigated the properties of the distribution of human solution times for Traveling Salesperson Problems (TSPs) with increasing numbers of nodes. New experimental data are presented that measure solution times for carefully chosen representative problems with 10, 20, . . . 120 nodes. We compared the solution times predicted by the convex hull procedure proposed by MacGregor and Ormerod (1996), the hierarchical approach of Graham, Joshi, and Pizlo (2000), and by five algorithms drawn from the artificial intelligence and operations research literature. The most likely polynomial model for describing the relationship between mean solution time and the size of a TSP is linear or near-linear over the range of problem sizes tested, supporting the earlier finding of Graham et al. (2000). We argue the properties of the solution time distributions place strong constraints on the development of detailed models of human performance for TSPs, and provide some evaluation of previously proposed models in light of our findings.},

  abstract = {Current challenges of using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level-based screening, such as the increased false positive rate, inability to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) with random biopsy, multifocality in PCa, and the molecular heterogeneity of PCa, can be addressed by integrating advanced multiparametric MR imaging (mpMRI) approaches into the diagnostic workup of PCa. The standard method for diagnosing PCa is a transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)guided systematic prostate biopsy, but it suffers from sampling errors and frequently fails to detect clinically significant PCa. mpMRI not only increases the detection of clinically significant PCa, but it also helps to reduce unnecessary biopsies because of its high negative predictive value. Furthermore, non-Cartesian image acquisition and compressed sensing have resulted in faster MR acquisition with improved signal-to-noise ratio, which can be used in quantitative MRI methods such as dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. With the growing emphasis on the role of pre-biopsy mpMRI in the evaluation of PCa, there is an increased demand for innovative MRI methods that can improve PCa grading, detect clinically significant PCa, and biopsy guidance. To meet these demands, in addition to routine T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DCE-MRI, diffusion MRI, and MR spectroscopy, several new MR methods such as restriction spectrum imaging, vascular, extracellular, and restricted diffusion for cytometry in tumors (VERDICT) method, hybrid multi-dimensional MRI, luminal water imaging, and MR fingerprinting have been developed for a better characterization of the disease. Further, with the increasing interest in combining MR data with clinical and genomic data, there is a growing interest in utilizing radiomics and radiogenomics approaches. These big data can also be utilized in the development of computer-aided diagnostic tools, including automatic segmentation and the detection of clinically significant PCa using machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {Accurate quantification in PET and SPECT requires correction for a number of physical factors, such as photon attenuation, Compton scattering and random coincidences (in PET). Another factor affecting quantification is the limited spatial resolution. While considerable effort has gone into development of routine correction techniques for the former factors, less attention has been paid to the latter. Spatial resolution-related effects, referred to as partial volume effects (PVEs), depend not only on the characteristics of the imaging system but also on the object and activity distribution. Spatial and/or temporal variations in PVE can often be confounding factors. Partial volume correction (PVC) could in theory be achieved by some kind of inverse filtering technique, reversing the effect of the system PSF. However, these methods are limited, and usually lead to noise-amplification or image artefacts. Some form of regularization is therefore needed, and this can be achieved using information from co-registered anatomical images, such as CT or MRI. The purpose of this paper is to enhance understanding of PVEs and to review possible approaches for PVC. We also present a review of clinical applications of PVC within the fields of neurology, cardiology and oncology, including specific examples. \textcopyright{} 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

Despite the widespread use of cortical folding patterns to perform ad hoc estimations of the locations of the BAs, little is understood regarding 1) how variable the position of a given BA is with respect to the folds, 2) whether the location of some BAs is more variable than others, and 3) whether the variability is related to the level of a BA in a putative cortical hierarchy. We use whole-brain histology of 10 postmortem human brains and surface-based analysis to test how well the folds predict the locations of the BAs. We show that higher order cortical areas exhibit more variability than primary and secondary areas and that the folds are much better predictors of the BAs than had been previously thought. These results further highlight the significance of cortical folding patterns and suggest a common mechanism for the development of the folds and the cytoarchitectonic fields.},

In this paper we present an automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal resting-state fMRI data, robustly, with low failure rates and high quality-assurance. The pipeline has been designed to specifically address the challenges that neonatal data presents including low and variable contrast and high levels of head motion. We provide a detailed description and evaluation of the pipeline which includes integrated slice-to-volume motion correction and dynamic susceptibility distortion correction, a robust multimodal registration approach, bespoke ICA-based denoising, and an automated QC framework. We assess these components on a large cohort of dHCP subjects and demonstrate that processing refinements integrated into the pipeline provide substantial reduction in movement related distortions, resulting in significant improvements in SNR, and detection of high quality RSNs from neonates.},

Prospective data on the natural history of change in structural markers from preclinical to overt stages of Alzheimer disease are radically changing how the disease is conceptualized, and will influence its future diagnosis and treatment. Atrophy of medial temporal structures is now considered to be a valid diagnostic marker at the mild cognitive impairment stage. Structural imaging is also included in diagnostic criteria for the most prevalent non-Alzheimer dementias, reflecting its value in differential diagnosis. In addition, rates of whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy are sensitive markers of neurodegeneration, and are increasingly used as outcome measures in trials of potentially disease-modifying therapies. Large multicenter studies are currently investigating the value of other imaging and nonimaging markers as adjuncts to clinical assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of progression. The utility of structural imaging and other markers will be increased by standardization of acquisition and analysis methods, and by development of robust algorithms for automated assessment. \textcopyright{} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Sufficient  evidence of analytical validity (phase 1 of a structured framework adapted from  oncology) is available for all biomarkers, but their clinical validity (phases 2  and 3) and clinical utility (phases 4 and 5) are incomplete. To complete these  phases, research priorities include the standardisation of the readout of these  assays and thresholds for normality, the evaluation of their performance in  detecting early disease, the development of diagnostic algorithms comprising  combinations of biomarkers, and the development of clinical guidelines for the  use of biomarkers in qualified memory clinics.},

  abstract = {This technical note describes the construction of posterior probability maps that enable conditional or Bayesian inferences about regionally specific effects in neuroimaging. Posterior probability maps are images of the probability or confidence that an activation exceeds some specified threshold, given the data. Posterior probability maps (PPMs) represent a complementary alternative to statistical parametric maps (SPMs) that are used to make classical inferences. However, a key problem in Bayesian inference is the specification of appropriate priors. This problem can be finessed using empirical Bayes in which prior variances are estimated from the data, under some simple assumptions about their form. Empirical Bayes requires a hierarchical observation model, in which higher levels can be regarded as providing prior constraints on lower levels. In neuroimaging, observations of the same effect over voxels provide a natural, two-level hierarchy that enables an empirical Bayesian approach. In this note we present a brief motivation and the operational details of a simple empirical Bayesian method for computing posterior probability maps. We then compare Bayesian and classical inference through the equivalent PPMs and SPMs testing for the same effect in the same data. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

It addresses the design and analysis of neuroimaging studies from these distinct perspectives but it is noted that they have to be combined for a full understanding of brain mapping results. Furthermore, this chapter deals with how a time series of images is realigned and mapped into some standard anatomical space. It also emphasizes on statistical parametric mapping, which is a voxel-based approach that employs classical inference to make some comment about regionally specific responses to experimental factors.

This is relevant when using the free energy as an approximation to the log-evidence in Bayesian model averaging and selection. By setting restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) in the larger context of variational learning and expectation maximisation (EM), we show how the ReML objective function can be adjusted to provide an approximation to the log-evidence for a particular model. This means ReML can be used for model selection, specifically to select or compare models with different covariance components. This is useful in the context of hierarchical models because it enables a principled selection of priors that, under simple hyperpriors, can be used for automatic model selection and relevance determination (ARD). Deriving the ReML objective function, from basic variational principles, discloses the simple relationships among Variational Bayes, EM and ReML. Furthermore, we show that EM is formally identical to a full variational treatment when the precisions are linear in the hyperparameters. Finally, we also consider, briefly, dynamic models and how these inform the regularisation of free energy ascent schemes, like EM and ReML. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The central question of the relationship between structure and function in the human brain is still not well understood. In order to investigate this fundamental relationship we create functional probabilistic maps from a large set of mapping experiments and compare the location of functionally localised regions across subjects using different whole-brain alignment schemes. To avoid the major problems associated with meta-analysis approaches, all subjects are scanned using the same paradigms, the same scanner and the same analysis pipeline. We show that an advanced, curvature driven cortex based alignment (CBA) scheme largely removes macro-anatomical variability across subjects. Remaining variability in the observed spatial location of functional regions, thus, reflects the "true" functional variability, i.e. the quantified variability is a good estimator of the underlying structural-functional correspondence. After localising 13 widely studied functional areas, we found a large variability in the degree to which functional areas respect macro-anatomical boundaries across the cortex. Some areas, such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) are strongly bound to a macro-anatomical location. Fusiform face area (FFA) on the other hand, varies in its location along the length of the fusiform gyrus even though the gyri themselves are well aligned across subjects. Language areas were found to vary greatly across subjects whilst a high degree of overlap was observed in sensory and motor areas. The observed differences in functional variability for different specialised areas suggest that a more complete estimation of the structure-function relationship across the whole cortex requires further empirical studies with an expanded test battery. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Surface visualizations of fMRI provide a comprehensive view of cortical activity. However, surface visualizations are difficult to generate and most common visualization techniques rely on unnecessary interpolation which limits the fidelity of the resulting maps. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the relationship between flattened cortical surfaces and the underlying 3D anatomy using tools available currently. To address these problems we have developed pycortex, a Python toolbox for interactive surface mapping and visualization. Pycortex exploits the power of modern graphics cards to sample volumetric data on a per-pixel basis, allowing dense and accurate mapping of the voxel grid across the surface. Anatomical, functional and fiduciary information can be projected onto the cortical surface. The surface can be inflated and flattened interactively, aiding interpretation of the correspondence between the anatomical surface and the flattened cortical sheet. The output of pycortex can be viewed using WebGL, a technology compatible with modern web browsers. This allows complex fMRI surface maps to be distributed broadly online without requiring installation of complex software.},

  abstract = {During the third trimester of human brain development, the cerebral cortex undergoes dramatic surface expansion and folding. Physical models suggest that relatively rapid growth of the cortical gray matter helps drive this folding, and structural data suggest that growth may vary in both space (by region on the cortical surface) and time. In this study, we propose a unique method to estimate local growth from sequential cortical reconstructions. Using anatomically constrained multimodal surface matching (aMSM), we obtain accurate, physically guided point correspondence between younger and older cortical reconstructions of the same individual. From each pair of surfaces, we calculate continuous, smooth maps of cortical expansion with unprecedented precision. By considering 30 preterm infants scanned two to four times during the period of rapid cortical expansion (28- 38 wk postmenstrual age), we observe significant regional differences in growth across the cortical surface that are consistent with the emergence of new folds. Furthermore, these growth patterns shift over the course of development, with noninjured subjects following a highly consistent trajectory. This information provides a detailed picture of dynamic changes in cortical growth, connecting what is known about patterns of development at the microscopic (cellular) and macroscopic (folding) scales. Since our method provides specific growth maps for individual brains, we are also able to detect alterations due to injury. This fully automated surface analysis, based on tools freely available to the brain-mapping community, may also serve as a useful approach for future studies of abnormal growth due to genetic disorders, injury, or other environmental variables.},

  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Aims:}} Arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI measures perfusion without administration of contrast agent. While ASL has been validated in animals and healthy volunteers (HVs), application to chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been limited. We investigated the utility of ASL MRI in patients with CKD. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} We studied renal perfusion in 24 HVs and 17 patients with CKD (age 22-77 years, 40\% male) using ASL MRI at 3.0T. Kidney function was determined using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). T1 relaxation time was measured using modified look-locker inversion and \&\#xFB02;ow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery true-fast imaging and steady precession was performed to measure cortical and whole kidney perfusion. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} T1 was higher in CKD within cortex and whole kidney, and there was association between T1 time and eGFR. No association was seen between kidney size and volume and either T1, or ASL perfusion. Perfusion was lower in CKD in cortex (136 {$\pm$} 37 vs. 279 {$\pm$} 69 ml/min/100 g; p {$<$} 0.001) and whole kidney (146 {$\pm$} 24 vs. 221 {$\pm$} 38 ml/min/100 g; p {$<$} 0.001). There was significant, negative, association between T1 longitudinal relaxation time and ASL perfusion in both the cortex (r = -0.75, p {$<$} 0.001) and whole kidney (r = -0.50, p {$<$} 0.001). There was correlation between eGFR and both cortical (r = 0.73, p {$<$} 0.01) and whole kidney (r = 0.69, p {$<$} 0.01) perfusion. \textbf{\emph{Conclusions:}} Significant differences in renal structure and function were demonstrated using ASL MRI. T1 may be representative of structural changes associated with CKD; however, further investigation is required into the pathological correlates of reduced ASL perfusion and increased T1 time in CKD.},

The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3. Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal 'fingerprint' of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6\% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease.},

Data-driven discovery of patterns of population variability in the brain has the potential to be extremely valuable for early disease diagnosis and understanding the brain. The resulting patterns can be used as imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs), and may complement existing expert-curated IDPs. However, population datasets, comprising many different structural and functional imaging modalities from thousands of subjects, provide a computational challenge not previously addressed. Here, for the first time, a multimodal independent component analysis approach is presented that is scalable for data fusion of voxel-level neuroimaging data in the full UK Biobank (UKB) dataset, that will soon reach 100,000 imaged subjects. This new computational approach can estimate modes of population variability that enhance the ability to predict thousands of phenotypic and behavioural variables using data from UKB and the Human Connectome Project. A high-dimensional decomposition achieved improved predictive power compared with widely-used analysis strategies, single-modality decompositions and existing IDPs. In UKB data (14,503 subjects with 47 different data modalities), many interpretable associations with non-imaging phenotypes were identified, including multimodal spatial maps related to fluid intelligence, handedness and disease, in some cases where IDP-based approaches failed.},

While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that BBR is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the BBR results to be robust and accurate.},

  abstract = {Exploratory (i.e., voxelwise) spatial methods are commonly used in neuroimaging to identify areas that show an effect when a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis cannot be performed because no strong a priori anatomical hypothesis exists. However, noise at a single voxel is much higher than noise in a ROI making noise management critical to successful exploratory analysis. This work explores how preprocessing choices affect the bias and variability of voxelwise kinetic modeling analysis of brain positron emission tomography (PET) data. These choices include the use of volume- or cortical surface-based smoothing, level of smoothing, use of voxelwise partial volume correction (PVC), and PVC masking threshold. PVC was implemented using the Muller-Gartner method with the masking out of voxels with low gray matter (GM) partial volume fraction. Dynamic PET scans of an antagonist serotonin-4 receptor radioligand ([11C]SB207145) were collected on sixteen healthy subjects using a Siemens HRRT PET scanner. Kinetic modeling was used to compute maps of non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) after preprocessing. The results showed a complicated interaction between smoothing, PVC, and masking on BPND estimates. Volume-based smoothing resulted in large bias and intersubject variance because it smears signal across tissue types. In some cases, PVC with volume smoothing paradoxically caused the estimated BPND to be less than when no PVC was used at all. When applied in the absence of PVC, cortical surface-based smoothing resulted in dramatically less bias and the least variance of the methods tested for smoothing levels 5mm and higher. When used in combination with PVC, surface-based smoothing minimized the bias without significantly increasing the variance. Surface-based smoothing resulted in 2-4 times less intersubject variance than when volume smoothing was used. This translates into more than 4 times fewer subjects needed in a group analysis to achieve similarly powered statistical tests. Surface-based smoothing has less bias and variance because it respects cortical geometry by smoothing the PET data only along the cortical ribbon and so does not contaminate the GM signal with that of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The use of surface-based analysis in PET should result in substantial improvements in the reliability and detectability of effects in exploratory PET analysis, with or without PVC. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Sensitivity to parameter selection was tested for MZ and MG. The various methods and parameter settings resulted in an extremely wide range of conclusions as to the effects of age on metabolism, from almost no changes to virtually all of cortical regions showing a decrease with age. Simulations showed that NoPVC had significant bias that made the age effect on metabolism appear to be much larger and more significant than it is. MZ was found to be the same as NoPVC for liberal brain masks; for conservative brain masks, MZ showed few areas correlated with age. MG and SGTM were found to be similar; however, MG was sensitive to a thresholding parameter that can result in data loss. CSF uptake was surprisingly high at about 15\% of that in gray matter. The exclusion of CSF from SGTM and MG models, which is almost universally done, caused a substantial loss in the power to detect age-related changes. This diversity of results reflects the literature on the metabolism of aging and suggests that extreme care should be taken when applying PVC or interpreting results that have been corrected for partial volume effects. Using the SGTM, significant age-related changes of about 7\% per decade were found in frontal and cingulate cortices as well as primary visual and insular cortices.},

  abstract = {Analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data restricted to the cortical surface is of particular interest for two reasons: (1) to increase detection sensitivity using anatomical constraints and (2) to compare or use fMRI results in the context of source localization from magneto/electro-encephalography (MEEG) data, which requires data to be projected on the same spatial support. Designing an optimal scheme to interpolate fMRI raw data or resulting activation maps on the cortical surface relies on a trade-off between choosing large enough interpolation kernels, because of the distributed nature of the hemodynamic response, and avoiding mixing data issued from different anatomical structures. We propose an original method that automatically adjusts the level of such a trade-off, by defining interpolation kernels around each vertex of the cortical surface using a geodesic Vorono\"i diagram. This Vorono\"i-based interpolation method was evaluated using simulated fMRI activation maps, manually generated on an anatomical MRI, and compared with a more standard approach where interpolation kernels were defined as local spheres of radius r = 3 or 5~mm. Several validation parameters were considered: the spatial resolution of the simulated activation map, the spatial resolution of the cortical mesh, the level of anatomical/functional data misregistration and the location of the vertices within the gray matter ribbon. Using an activation map at the spatial resolution of standard fMRI data, robustness to misregistration errors was observed for both methods, whereas only the Vorono\"i-based approach was insensitive to the position of the vertices within the gray matter ribbon. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {When modelling FMRI and other MRI time-series data, a Bayesian approach based on adaptive spatial smoothness priors is a compelling alternative to using a standard generalized linear model (GLM) on presmoothed data. Another benefit of the Bayesian approach is that biophysical prior information can be incorporated in a principled manner; however, this requirement for a fixed non-spatial prior on a parameter would normally preclude using spatial regularization on that same parameter. We have developed a Gaussian-process-based prior to apply adaptive spatial regularization while still ensuring that the fixed biophysical prior is correctly applied on each voxel. A parameterized covariance matrix provides separate control over the variance (the diagonal elements) and the between-voxel correlation (due to off-diagonal elements). Analysis proceeds using evidence optimization (EO), with variational Bayes (VB) updates used for some parameters. The method can also be applied to non-linear forward models by using a linear Taylor expansion centred on the latest parameter estimates. Applying the method to FMRI with a constrained haemodynamic response function (HRF) shape model shows improved fits in simulations, compared to using either the non-spatial or spatial-smoothness prior alone. We also analyse multi-inversion arterial spin labelling data using a non-linear perfusion model to estimate cerebral blood flow and bolus arrival time. By combining both types of prior information, this new prior performs consistently well across a wider range of situations than either prior alone, and provides better estimates when both types of prior information are relevant. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Determination of cortical thickness using MRI has often been criticized due to the presence of various error sources. Specifically, anatomical MRI relying on T 1 contrast may be unreliable due to spatially variable image contrast between gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Especially at ultra-high field ({$\geq$} 7T) MRI, transmit and receive B 1 -related image inhomogeneities can hamper correct classification of tissue types. In the current paper, we demonstrate that residual B 1+ (transmit) inhomogeneities in the T 1 -weighted and quantitative T 1 images using the MP2RAGE sequence at 7T lead to biases in cortical thickness measurements. As expected, post-hoc correction for the spatially varying B 1+ profile reduced the apparent T 1 values across the cortex in regions with low B 1+ , and slightly increased apparent T 1 in regions with high B 1+ . As a result, improved contrast-to-noise ratio both at the GM-CSF and GM-WM boundaries can be observed leading to more accurate surface reconstructions and cortical thickness estimates. Overall, the changes in cortical thickness ranged between a 5\% decrease to a 70\% increase after B 1+ correction, reducing the variance of cortical thickness values across the brain dramatically and increasing the comparability with normative data. More specifically, the cortical thickness estimates increased in regions characterized by a strong decrease of apparent T 1 after B 1+ correction in regions with low B 1+ due to improved detection of the pial surface . The current results suggest that cortical thickness can be more accurately determined using MP2RAGE data at 7T if B 1+ inhomogeneities are accounted for.},

HCP-D is enrolling 1300+ healthy children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 5\textendash 21), and HCP-A is enrolling 1200+ healthy adults (ages 36\textendash 100+), with each study collecting longitudinal data in a subset of individuals at particular age ranges. The imaging protocols of the HCP-D and HCP-A studies are very similar, differing primarily in the selection of different task-fMRI paradigms. We strove to harmonize the imaging protocol to the greatest extent feasible with the completed HCP-YA (1200+ participants, aged 22\textendash 35), but some imaging-related changes were motivated or necessitated by hardware changes, the need to reduce the total amount of scanning per participant, and/or the additional challenges of working with young and elderly populations. Here, we provide an overview of the common HCP-D/A imaging protocol including data and rationales for protocol decisions and changes relative to HCP-YA. The result will be a large, rich, multi-modal, and freely available set of consistently acquired data for use by the scientific community to investigate and define normative developmental and aging related changes in the healthy human brain.},

Reduction in the volume of the temporal grey matter was more marked on the right, but was not in excess of the loss of volume observed in other areas of the cortex. MRI abnormalities correlated poorly with clinical parameters, although both unemployment and poor pre-morbid adjustment predicted reduced cerebral volume and increased sulcal volume.

Sub-voxel measurements of thickness are possible using sub-sampling and interpolation of the image information. The method is applied to repeated MRI scans of a single subject from two MRI scanners to demonstrate its robustness and reproducibility. A simulated data set is used to show that small focal differences in thickness between two groups of subjects can be detected. We propose that the analysis of VBCT maps can provide results that are complementary to other anatomical analyses such as voxel-based morphometry. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It has the potential to be used not only for evaluation of physiological and pathological states, but also for prediction of disease course. Although different MRI sequences have been employed in renal disease, there are few studies that have compared the different sequences. We compared several multiparametric MRI sequences, and compared their results with the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Principal component analysis showed a similarity between T1 values and tissue perfusion (arterial spin labelling), and between fractional anisotropy (diffusion tensor imaging) and apparent diffusion coefficient values (diffusion-weighted imaging). In multiple regression analysis, only T2* values, derived from the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI sequence, were associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate slope after adjusting for degree of proteinuria, a classic prognostic factor for CKD. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, T2* values were a good predictor of rapid deterioration, regardless of the degree of proteinuria. This suggests further study of the use of BOLD-derived T2* values in the workup of CKD, especially to predict the disease course.},

  abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is the primary non-invasive MRI approach to measure baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) in healthy subjects and patients. ASL also allows concurrent functional BOLD signal and CBF measurements, but the latter typically suffer from low contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio. Ultra-high-field imaging significantly boosts BOLD signal CNR. However, it is contested whether also CBF CNR benefits from increasing magnetic field strength, especially given that technical challenges related to field inhomogeneities and power deposition constraints exist. Recently, we presented an optimized PASL technique that utilizes tr-FOCI inversion pulses and dielectric pads to overcome the temporal resolution limitations of previous 7T ASL implementations (Ivanov et al., in press; 2017). The primary goal of this study was to compare its performance to that of 3T ASL approaches \textendash{} both pulsed ASL (PASL) and pseudo-continuous (pCASL) \textendash{} concerning functional studies using simultaneous CBF and BOLD signal acquisition. To this aim, we investigated a wide range of parameters that can influence CBF and BOLD signal sensitivities: spatial resolution, labeling scheme, parallel imaging and echo time. We found that 7T ASL is superior in terms of CBF and BOLD temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and activation volume compared to all 3T ASL variants, in particular at high spatial resolution. Our results show that the advantages of 7T for ASL stem from increased image SNR, especially when parallel imaging is used. The gray matter baseline CBF was in good agreement for all 3T ASL variants, but a significantly lower value was obtained at 7T. The labeling scheme utilized was also found to significantly influence the measured perfusion territories CBF. In conclusion, a single-echo accelerated 7T PASL is recommended for high spatial and temporal resolution CBF and BOLD imaging, while a 3T dual-echo pCASL approach without parallel imaging may be preferred for low (i.e., 3mm isotropic and lower) resolution functional perfusion and BOLD applications.},

Five AD biomarkers are sufficiently validated to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic criteria and commonly used in therapeutic trials. Current AD biomarkers fall into two categories: biomarkers of amyloid-{$\beta$} plaques and of tau-related neurodegeneration. Three of the five are imaging measures and two are cerebrospinal fluid analytes. AD biomarkers do not evolve in an identical manner but rather in a sequential but temporally overlapping manner. Models of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers can take the form of plots of biomarker severity (degree of abnormality) versus time. In this Review, we discuss several time-dependent models of AD that take into consideration varying age of onset (early versus late) and the influence of aging and co-occurring brain pathologies that commonly arise in the elderly. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Introduction Our goal was to develop cut points for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, flouro-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and MRI cortical thickness. Methods We examined five methods for determining cut points. Results The reliable worsening method produced a cut point only for amyloid PET. The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of cognitively impaired versus young clinically normal (CN) methods labeled the most people abnormal and all gave similar cut points for tau PET, FDG PET, and cortical thickness. Cut points defined using the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus age-matched CN method labeled fewer people abnormal. Discussion In the future, we will use a single cut point for amyloid PET (standardized uptake value ratio, 1.42; centiloid, 19) based on the reliable worsening cut point method. We will base lenient cut points for tau PET, FDG PET, and cortical thickness on the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus young CN method and base conservative cut points on the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus age-matched CN method.},

  abstract = {Importance: A National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) workgroup recently published a research framework in which Alzheimer disease is defined by neuropathologic or biomarker evidence of {$\beta$}-amyloid plaques and tau tangles and not by clinical symptoms. Objectives: To estimate the sex- and age-specific prevalence of 3 imaging biomarker-based definitions of the Alzheimer disease spectrum from the NIA-AA research framework and to compare these entities with clinically defined diagnostic entities commonly linked with Alzheimer disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) is a population-based cohort study of cognitive aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota. The MCSA in-person participants (n = 4660) and passively ascertained (ie, through the medical record rather than in-person) individuals with dementia (n = 553) aged 60 to 89 years were included. Subsets underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) (n = 1524) or both amyloid and tau PET (n = 576). Therefore, this study included 3 nested cohorts examined between November 29, 2004, and June 5, 2018. Data were analyzed between February 19, 2018, and March 26, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sex- and age-specific prevalence of the following 3 biologically defined diagnostic entities was estimated: Alzheimer continuum (abnormal amyloid regardless of tau status), Alzheimer pathologic change (abnormal amyloid but normal tau), and Alzheimer disease (abnormal amyloid and tau). These were compared with the prevalence of 3 clinically defined diagnostic groups (mild cognitive impairment or dementia, dementia, and clinically defined probable Alzheimer disease). Results: The median (interquartile range) age was 77 (72-83) years in the clinical cohort (n = 5213 participants), 77 (70-83) years in the amyloid PET cohort (n = 1524 participants), and 77 (69-83) years in the tau PET cohort (n = 576 participants). There were roughly equal numbers of women and men. The prevalence of all diagnostic entities (biological and clinical) increased rapidly with age, with the exception of Alzheimer pathologic change. The prevalence of biological Alzheimer disease was greater than clinically defined probable Alzheimer disease for women and men. Among women, these values were 10\% (95\% CI, 6\%-14\%) vs 1\% (95\% CI, 1\%-1\%) at age 70 years and 33\% (95\% CI, 25\%-41\%) vs 10\% (95\% CI, 9\%-12\%) at age 85 years (P {$<$}.001). Among men, these values were 9\% (95\% CI, 5\%-12\%) vs 1\% (95\% CI, 0\%-1\%) at age 70 years and 31\% (95\% CI, 24\%-38\%) vs 9\% (95\% CI, 8\%-11\%) at age 85 years (P {$<$}.001). The only notable difference by sex was a greater prevalence of the mild cognitive impairment or dementia clinical category among men than women. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that biologically defined Alzheimer disease is more prevalent than clinically defined probable Alzheimer disease at any age and is 3 times more prevalent at age 85 years among both women and men. This difference is mostly driven by asymptomatic individuals with biological Alzheimer disease. These findings illustrate the magnitude of the consequences on public health that potentially exist by intervening with disease-specific treatments to prevent symptom onset.},

The predicted center is around the probability of variation in the estimation of retinal veins, and the crisp enrolls vessel development inside the retina. To witness the changes segmentation of retinal blood vessels has to be made. A framework to upgrade the quality of the segmentation results over morbid retinal images is proposed. This framework utilizes Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for eliminating the background from the source image and enhances the foreground blood vessel pixels, Tandem Pulse Coupled Neural Network (TPCNN) model is endorsed for automatic feature vectors generation, and Deep Learning Based Support Vector Machine (DLBSVM) is proposed for classification and extraction of blood vessels. The DLBSVM parameters are fine-tuned via Firefly algorithm. The STARE, DRIVE, HRF, REVIEW, and DRIONS fundus image datasets are deliberated to assess the recommended techniques. The results render that the proposed technologies improve the segmentation with 80.61\% Sensitivity, 99.54\% Specificity, and 99.49\% Accuracy.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Twenty subjects with AD (13 men, seven women; mean age, 72.9 years), 18 with MCI (nine men, nine women; mean age, 73.3 years), and 23 CN subjects (10 men, 13 women; mean age, 72.9 years) underwent arterial spin-labeling and volumetric T1-weighted structural MR imaging. Perfusion images were coregistered to structural images, corrected for partial volume effects (PVEs) with information from the structural image to determine tissue content of perfusion voxels, and normalized to a study-specific template. Analyses of perfusion differences between groups, with and without corrections for PVEs, were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis with a one-tailed fixed-effects analysis of covariance model adjusted for age. In addition, tests were performed with and without accounting for global perfusion. RESULTS: The AD group showed significant regional hypoperfusion, compared with the CN group, in the right inferior parietal cortex extending into the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (P {$<$} .001), bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri (P {$<$} .001), and left inferior parietal lobe (P = .007). When PVEs from underlying cortical gray matter atrophy were accounted for, the AD group still showed hypoperfusion in the right inferior parietal lobe extending into the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (P {$<$} .001) and left (P = .003) and right (P = .012) middle frontal gyri. With a more liberal voxel-level threshold of P {$<$} .01, the MCI group showed significant regional hypoperfusion relative to the CN group in the inferior right parietal lobe (P = .046), similar to the region of greatest significance in the AD group. CONCLUSION: Arterial spin-labeling MR imaging showed regional hypoperfusion with AD, in brain regions similar to those seen in FDG PET and HMPAO SPECT studies of similar populations; this hypoperfusion persists after accounting for underlying cortical gray matter atrophy. ?

Selective RF saturation pulses with standard 2D and 3D MRI acquisition schemes are now routinely performed, and CEST MRI can produce semi-quantitative results using Magnetization Transfer Ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) analysis while accounting for B0 inhomogeneity. Faster clinical CEST MRI acquisition methods and more quantitative acquisition and analysis routines are under development. Endogenous biomolecules with amide, amine, and hydroxyl groups have been detected during clinical CEST MRI studies, and exogenous CEST agents have also been administered to patients. These CEST MR imaging tools show promise for contributing to assessments of cerebral ischemia, neurological disorders, lymphedema, osteoarthritis, muscle physiology, and solid tumors. This review summarizes the salient features of clinical CEST MRI protocols and critically evaluates the utility of CEST MRI for these clinical imaging applications.},

These algorithms scan-convert 3D geometric objects into their discrete voxel-map representation within a Cubic Frame Bugler (CFB). The geometric objects that are studied here include three-dimensional lines, polygons (optionally filled), polyhedra (optionally filled), cubic parametric curves, bicubic parametric surface patches, circles (optionally filled), and quadratic objects (optionally filled) like those used in constructive solid geometry: cylinders, cones, and spheres. All algorithms presented here do scan-conversion with computational complexity which is linear in the number of voxels written to the CFB. All algorithms are incremental and use only additions, subtractions, tests and simpler operations inside the inner algorithm loops. Since the algorithms are basically sequential, the temporal complexity is also linear. However, the polyhedron-fill and sphere-fill algorithms have less than linear temporal complexity, as they use a mechan-ism for writing a voxel run into the CFB. The temporal complexity would then be linear with the number of pixels in the object's 2D projection. All algorithms have been implemented as part of the CUBE Architecture, which is a voxel-based system for 3D graphics. The CUBE architecture is also presented.},

In a previous communication, we showed how AIBF can be used to incorporate prior anatomical constraints in single subject functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) analyses to augment their anatomical precision. In this paper, we extend AIBF such that it can be applied to multisubject studies using fMRI or PET. The key concept is that, after spatial normalization, a canonical cortical surface can be used to generate a forward model of signal sources for all subjects. By estimating the hemodynamic signal in this canonical AIBF-space and then projecting it back into the voxel-space, one effectively extracts functional activity that is smooth, within and only within, the cortical sheet while attenuating other components unrelated to the physiological process of interest. The ensuing procedure can be considered as a highly non-stationary, anisotropic anatomically informed [de]convolution or smoothing. It is shown that this procedure offers various advantages compared to existing conventional methods for the analysis of multisubject studies, in particular it is more sensitive to underlying activations.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

Methods: Persons with AD dementia and elevated brain {$\beta$}-Amyloid with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging underwent [ 18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and structural MRI. We evaluated 3 AD-related neurodegeneration biomarkers: hippocampal volume adjusted for total intracranial volume (HVa), FDG standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in regions of interest linked to AD, and cortical thickness in AD-related regions of interest. We examined associations of each biomarker with age and evaluated age effects on cutpoints defined by the 90th percentile in AD dementia. We assembled an age-, sex-, and intracranial volume-matched group of 194 similarly imaged clinically normal (CN) persons. Results: The 97 participants with AD dementia (aged 49-93 years) had PiB SUVR {$\geq$}1.8. A nonlinear (inverted-U) relationship between FDG SUVR and age was seen in the AD group but an inverse linear relationship with age was seen in the CN group. Cortical thickness had an inverse linear relationship with age in AD but a nonlinear (flat, then inverse linear) relationship in the CN group. HVa showed an inverse linear relationship with age in both AD and CN groups. Age effects on 90th percentile cutpoints were small for FDG SUVR and cortical thickness, but larger for HVa. Conclusions: In persons with AD dementia with elevated PiB SUVR, values of each neurodegeneration biomarker were associated with age. Cortical thickness had the smallest differences in 90th percentile cutpoints from middle to old age, and HVa the largest differences.},

  abstract = {The field of Alzheimer disease (AD) has a nosologic problem: The diagnostic label "Alzheimer disease" has several distinctive meanings. The term probable AD was introduced in 1984 to designate a clinically diagnosed acquired and progressive amnestic dementia for which there was no evidence for another etiology. Probable AD represented a clinicopathologic entity that assumed a specific and sensitive linkage between amnestic dementia and the neuropathology of {$\beta$}-amyloid-containing neuritic plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. The clinicopathologic model represented by probable AD was adapted in abbreviated form for population-based studies and general clinical practice, although the uncertainty connoted by "probable" was often overlooked. Representing the growing public awareness of later life cognitive impairment, a vernacular meaning of AD arose out of the clinicopathologic model in which AD represented all dementia not due to another clinically apparent cause. In contrast, by the 1990s, neuropathologists settled on a definition of AD based entirely on a sufficient burden of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles at postmortem examination, regardless of antemortem clinical status. In the last decade, the availability of fluid and imaging biomarkers that measure {$\beta$}-amyloid and tau abnormalities has enabled antemortem pathobiological diagnoses, highlighting the divide between the clinicopathologic model, the vernacular usage, and the pathobiological models. Each definition has value. However, the meanings of AD as defined by each of these models are not interchangeable. The pathobiological one is the only one that is unambiguous.},

  abstract = {The traveling salesman problem, (form a cir-cuit through N points with no subloops in such a way as to minimize the length of the circuit), is a close kin to many board wiring problems. It has been attacked by many mathematical methods with only meager results. Only for special forms of the problem or for problems with relatively few points can it be solved exactly evin using very large amounts of computer time. Heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested with only slightly better results. This paper will describe a computer-aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real time to solve large (100-200) point prob-lems. This technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem solving abilities. The computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as is the case in many of today's heuristics but it is asked to organize the data for the human in a fashion that allows the human to solve the problem easily. The techniques employed in this paper require that the computer and the hjiman cooperate to find the solution to the problem in reasonable amounts of both of their times. The computer initially uses a series of heuristics that produce groups of points and some partial connections of these points. The human is asked to connect the points within the groups and then connect the groups in a manner that produces a circuit and appears to the human to maximize the ratio of enclosed area to perimeter. The computer takes this solution and uses another set of heuristics to make im-provements. The solution is displayed to the hijtman and if he is satisfied the procedure stops; if not the former procedure is repeated until the human is satisfied that cost for finding a better solution exceeds his estimate of the best possible improvement that eould be obtained by further work. The heuristic procedures seek to group points around information obtained from solving a series of mathematical programming problems (assignment problems) and some observed correlations between these problems and the traveling salesman problem. The results are very good. The man-machine interaction solution for all problems in the literature is within one per cent of the solution for a fraction of the computer time. The experi-ence to date indicates that the technique can be taught to inexperienced persons and their results, after training, are similar to those of the authors'.},

  abstract = {The accurate quantification of positron emission tomography (PET) data is limited by partial volume effects (PVE), which depend on the size of the structure studied in relation to the spatial resolution and which may lead to over- or underestimation of the true tissue tracer concentration. This study describes a new approach to measure accurately the true tracer activity within multiple volumes of interest (VOI) of any size and shape. This approach to PVE correction is based on (1) segmenting magnetic resonance (MR) images into anatomical probabilistic maps of cerebrospinal fluid and white and gray matter, with further subdivision into multiple VOIs; (2) convolving each segmented probabilistic MR map with a PET point spread function; and (3) solving the resultant linear set of equations, Ax = b, where b is the PET image, A contains all the convolved MR VOI images, and x contains the unknown tracer concentrations to be estimated. The solution is obtained using a linear least-squares (LLS) approach giving simultaneous estimates of all parameters corrected for PVE, without restriction on the number of VOIs. The method and the algorithm were validated with computer simulations and an anthropomorphic phantom model. The LLS method was applied to human [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET studies of two patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and histologically verified unilateral hippocampal sclerosis. After PVE correction, the in vivo measurement of reduced FMZ volume of distribution within the hippocampus corresponded to the ex vivo, autoradiographically determined reduction of FMZ receptor availability. This PVE correction method allows accurate PET quantification in multiple small cerebral structures and has been directly validated with independent autoradiographic data.},

Our aim is to quantify UK-based randomised controlled trials (RCTs) accessing RCHD for participant data, characterise how these data are used and thereby recommend how more trials could use RCHD. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs accessing RCHD from at least one registry in the UK between 2013-2018, for the purposes of informing or supplementing participant data. A list of all registries holding RCHD in the UK was compiled. In cases where registries published release registers, these were searched for RCTs accessing RCHD. Where no release register was available, registries were contacted to request a list of RCTs. For each identified RCT, information was collected from all publicly available sources (release registers, websites, protocol etc.). The search and data extraction was undertaken between Jan-2019 and May-2019. Results: We identified 160 RCTs accessing RCHD between 2013 and 2018 from a total of 22 registries; this corresponds to only a very small proportion of all UK RCTs (approximately 3\%). RCTs accessing RCHD were generally large (median sample size 1590), commonly evaluating treatments for cancer or cardiovascular disease. Most of the included RCTs accessed RCHD from NHS Digital (68\%), and the most frequently accessed datasets were mortality (76\%) and hospital visits (55\%). RCHD was used to inform the primary trial (82\%) and long-term follow-up (57\%). There was substantial variation in how RCTs used RCHD to inform participant outcome measures. A limitation was the lack of information and transparency from registries and RCTs with respect to which datasets have been accessed and for what purposes. Conclusions: In the last five years, only a small minority of UK-based RCTs have accessed RCHD to inform participant data. We ask for improved accessibility, confirmed data quality and joined up thinking between the registries and the regulatory authorities.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate a large panel of ventilators to allow clinicians to choose a device, taking into account their specificities of use.Methods: This experimental bench-test took into account general characteristics and technical performances. Performances were assessed under different levels of FIO2 (100\%, 50\% or Air-Mix), respiratory mechanics (compliance 30,70,120~mL/cmH2O; resistance 5,10,20 cmH2O/mL/s), and levels of leaks (3.5 to 12.5~L/min), using a test lung.Results: In total 26 emergency and transport ventilators were analyzed and classified into four categories (ICU-like, n = 5; Sophisticated, n = 10; Simple, n = 9; Mass-casualty and military, n = 2). Oxygen consumption (7.1 to 15.8~L/min at FIO2 100\%) and the Air-Mix mode (FIO2 45 to 86\%) differed from one device to the other. Triggering performance was heterogeneous, but several sophisticated ventilators depicted triggering capabilities as efficient as ICU-like ventilators. Pressurization was not adequate for all devices. At baseline, all the ventilators were able to synchronize, but with variations among respiratory conditions. Leak compensation in most ICU-like and 4/10 sophisticated devices was able to correct at least partially for system leaks, but with variations among ventilators.Conclusion: Major differences were observed between devices and categories, either in terms of general characteristics or technical reliability, across the spectrum of operation. Huge variability of tidal volume delivery with some devices in response to modifications in respiratory mechanics and FIO2 should make clinicians question their use in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Arterial-spin-labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is intrinsically a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) technique. This study aims to enhance its sensitivity by quantifying physiological noise attributed to cardiac pulsation and devising an improved sequence, cardiac-triggered ASL, to minimize this noise. Methods: A total of 16 healthy subjects were studied on a 3 Tesla MRI system. The influence of cardiac pulsation on pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) signal was first investigated by performing a regular pCASL sequence while the cardiac phase of the image acquisition was recorded by a pulse oximeter. We then designed a new sequence, cardiac-triggered pCASL, to align the cardiac phases of the control and labeled scans. The performance of the new sequence was evaluated in the context of single-shot 3D gradient-and-spin-echo acquisition, multishot 3D spiral acquisition, and hypercapnia-induced cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes. Results: In regular pCASL, the signal intensities of both control and labeled images were strongly modulated by the cardiac phase. In single-shot acquisitions, this results in signal instability in regions near large vessels. In segmented acquisitions, it results in ghosting artifacts in the image and, furthermore, the signal fluctuation is smeared along the segmentation direction to affect more brain regions. Cardiac-triggered pCASL enhanced the temporal SNR by 94\% and 28\% in single-shot and segmented 3D acquisition, respectively. When applied to detect CBF changes, the triggered sequence revealed a greater statistical power in terms of both the number of significant voxels and t-score histograms. Conclusion: Cardiac-triggered pCASL represents a potential scheme to enhance the reliability of ASL signal.

This can be an important source of cerebral blood flow quantification error. To correct for partial volume effect in arterial spin labeling, a linear regression method was recently proposed. Because this method assumes that tissue magnetization and cerebral blood flow are constant over an n2 \texttimes{} 1 regression kernel, an inherent spatial blurring is introduced. In this study, a modified least trimmed squares algorithm is proposed for partial volume effect correction. It is demonstrated using simulations that the modified least trimmed square method can correct for partial volume effect and produce less blurring than the linear regression method. This is achieved without either acquiring additional datasets or increasing the computation burden. These capabilities were further demonstrated in vivo. The modified least trimmed square method should, therefore, play an important role in arterial spin labeling studies. Magn Reson Med, 2013. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Key points: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. Alzheimer's disease (AD), via frontal compensatory processes, may affect PNS regulation, thereby compromising older adults' capacity for adaptation, and increasing morbidity and mortality risk. Here we found that AD-associated neurodegeneration accompanied an overactive anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn resulted in a high level of PNS activity at rest, as well as strong PNS activity withdrawal in response to the mental effort. This discovery provides the first line of evidence to suggest that AD-associated neurodegeneration links to altered PNS regulation during mental effort in older adults, and that the compensatory processes accompanying frontal hyperactivation appear to be responsible for these alterations. Abstract: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. PNS can reflect an individual's regulatory capacity of frontal brain regions and has been linked to cognitive capacity. Yet, the relationship of PNS function to cognitive decline and abnormal frontal function that characterize preclinical progression toward Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between PNS function and AD-associated neurodegeneration by testing two competing hypotheses involving frontal regions' activity (neurodegeneration vs. compensation). In 38 older human adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or normative cognition, we measured AD-associated neurodegeneration (AD signature cortical thickness; ADSCT), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of frontal regions' spontaneous activation, and an electrocardiography measure of PNS (high frequency heart rate variability; HF-HRV). HF-HRV was assessed at rest and during a cognitive task protocol designed to capture HF-HRV reactivity. Higher HF-HRV at rest was significantly related to both more severe AD-associated neurodegeneration (lower ADSCT scores) and worse cognitive ability. Cognitive impairments were also related to greater suppression of HF-HRV reactivity. High activities of the anterior cingulate cortex significantly mediated relationships between ADSCT and both HF-HRV at rest and HF-HRV reactivity. Notably, these relationships were not affected by the clinical phenotype. We show that AD-associated neurodegeneration is associated with altered PNS regulation and that compensatory processes linked to frontal overactivation might be responsible for those alterations. This finding provides the first line of evidence in a new framework for understanding how early-stage AD-associated neurodegeneration affects autonomic regulation.},

Its segmentation in fundus imaging is a nontrivial task due to variable size of vessels, relatively low contrast, and potential presence of pathologies like microaneurysms and hemorrhages. Many algorithms, both unsupervised and supervised, have been proposed for this purpose in the past. We propose a supervised segmentation technique that uses a deep neural network trained on a large (up to 400 000) sample of examples preprocessed with global contrast normalization, zero-phase whitening, and augmented using geometric transformations and gamma corrections. Several variants of the method are considered, including structured prediction, where a network classifies multiple pixels simultaneously. When applied to standard benchmarks of fundus imaging, the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE databases, the networks significantly outperform the previous algorithms on the area under ROC curve measure (up to {$>$} 0.99) and accuracy of classification (up to {$>$} 0.97). The method is also resistant to the phenomenon of central vessel reflex, sensitive in detection of fine vessels (sensitivity {$>$} 0.87), and fares well on pathological cases.},

  abstract = {Purpose To investigate the pathophysiologic effects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on brain function in children with CKD by correlating cerebral blood flow (CBF) with clinical and behavioral indexes. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 73 pediatric patients with CKD (mean age, 15.80 years {$\pm$} 3.63; range, 9\textendash 25 years) and 57 control subjects (mean age, 15.65 years {$\pm$} 3.76; range, 9\textendash 25 years) were recruited. CBF measurements were acquired with an MRI arterial spin labeling scheme. Neurocognitive measurements were performed with traditional and computerized neurocognitive batteries. Clinical data were also collected. Group-level global and regional CBF differences between patients with CKD and control subjects were assessed. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations among regional CBF, clinical variables, and cognitive performance. Results Patients with CKD showed higher global CBF compared with control subjects that was attributable to reduced hematocrit level (mean, 60.2 mL/100 g/min {$\pm$} 9.0 vs 56.5 mL/100 g/min {$\pm$} 8.0, respectively). White matter CBF showed correlation with blood pressure (r = 0.244, P = .039), a finding suggestive of altered cerebrovascular autoregulation. Regional CBF differences between patients and control subjects included regions in the ``default mode'' network. In patients with CKD, positive extrema in the precuneus showed a strong correlation with executive function ({$\rho$} = 0.608, P = .001). Conclusion Systemic effects of estimated glomerular filtration rate, hematocrit level, and blood pressure on CBF and alterations in regional CBF may reflect impaired brain function underlying neurocognitive symptoms in CKD. These findings further characterize the nature of alterations in brain physiologic features in children, adolescents, and young adults with CKD., \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2018,                             Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

It also explores the way in which fold variants in registration templates affect the quality of registration. Finally, it shows that hemisphere-specific group registration templates systematically better register subject hemispheres of the same laterality, underlining the need to develop templates free of hemisphere bias for asymmetry analysis. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The experiments tested the hypothesis that complexity of TSPs is a function of number of nonboundary points, not total number of points. Both experiments supported the hypothesis. The experiments provided information on the quality of subjects' solutions. Their solutions clustered close to the best known solutions, were an order of magnitude better than solutions produced by three well-known heuristics, and on average fell beyond the 99.9th percentile in the distribution of random solutions. The solution process appeared to be perceptually based.},

In previous research, we have found that the quality of solutions produced by human participants for small TSPs compares well with solutions from a range of computer algorithms. We have proposed that the ability of participants to find solutions reflects the natural properties of human perception, solutions being found through global perceptual processing of the problem array to extract a best figure from the TSP points. In this paper, we extend the study of human performance on the task in order to understand further how human abilities are utilised in solving real-world TSPs. The results of experiment 1 show that high levels of solution quality are maintained in solving larger TSPs than had been investigated previously with human participants, and that the presence of an implied real-world context in the problems has no effect upon performance. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the presence of regularity in the point layout of a TSP can facilitate performance. This was confirmed in experiment 3, where effects of the internality of point clusters were also found. All three experiments were consistent with a global, perceptually based approach to the problem by participants. We suggest that the role of perceptual processing in spatial problem-solving is an important area for further research in both theoretical and applied domains.},

  abstract = {Multiple echo-time arterial spin labelling (multi-TE ASL) offers estimation of blood\textendash tissue exchange dynamics by probing the T2 relaxation of the labelled spins. In this study, we provide a recipe for robust assessment of exchange time (Texch) as a proxy measure of blood\textendash brain barrier (BBB) integrity based on a test-retest analysis. This includes a novel scan protocol and an extension of the two-compartment model with an ``intra-voxel transit time'' (ITT) to address tissue transit effects. With the extended model, we intend to separate the underlying two distinct mechanisms of tissue transit and exchange. The performance of the extended model in comparison with the two-compartment model was evaluated in simulations. Multi-TE ASL sequence with two different bolus durations was used to acquire               in vivo               data (               n               = 10). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterial transit time (ATT) and Texch were fitted with the two models, and mean grey matter values were compared. Additionally, the extended model also extracted ITT parameter. The test-retest reliability of Texch was assessed for intra-session, inter-session and inter-visit pairs of measurements. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variance (CoV) for grey matter were computed to assess the precision of the method. Mean grey matter Texch and ITT values were found to be 227.9 {$\pm$} 37.9 ms and 310.3 {$\pm$} 52.9 ms, respectively. Texch estimated by the extended model was 32.6 {$\pm$} 5.9\% lower than the two-compartment model. A significant ICC was observed for all three measures of Texch reliability (               P               \&lt; 0.05). Texch intra-session CoV, inter-session CoV and inter-visit CoV were found to be 6.6\%, 7.9\%, and 8.4\%, respectively. With the described improvements addressing intra-voxel transit effects, multi-TE ASL shows good reproducibility as a non-invasive measure of BBB permeability. These findings offer an encouraging step forward to apply this potential BBB permeability biomarker in clinical research.},

Especially standard fitting using non-linear least squares often fails in regions with poor SNR, resulting in noisy estimates of the quantitative maps. State-of-the-art fitting techniques improve the SNR by incorporating prior knowledge in the estimation process which typically leads to spatial blurring. To this end, we propose a new estimation method with a joint spatial total generalized variation regularization on CBF and ATT. This joint regularization approach utilizes shared spatial features across maps to enhance sharpness and simultaneously improves noise suppression in the final estimates. The proposed method is validated in three stages, first on synthetic phantom data, including pathologies, followed by in vivo acquisitions of healthy volunteers, and finally on patient data following an ischemic stroke. The quantitative estimates are compared to two reference methods, non-linear least squares fitting and a state-of-the-art ASL quantification algorithm based on Bayesian inference. The proposed joint regularization approach outperforms the reference implementations, substantially increasing the SNR in CBF and ATT while maintaining sharpness and quantitative accuracy in the estimates.

  abstract = {Purpose: To estimate multiple components within a single voxel in magnetic resonance fingerprinting when the number and types of tissues comprising the voxel are not known a priori. Theory: Multiple tissue components within a single voxel are potentially separable with magnetic resonance fingerprinting as a result of differences in signal evolutions of each component. The Bayesian framework for inverse problems provides a natural and flexible setting for solving this problem when the tissue composition per voxel is unknown. Assuming that only a few entries from the dictionary contribute to a mixed signal, sparsity-promoting priors can be placed upon the solution. Methods: An iterative algorithm is applied to compute the maximum a posteriori estimator of the posterior probability density to determine the magnetic resonance fingerprinting dictionary entries that contribute most significantly to mixed or pure voxels. Results: Simulation results show that the algorithm is robust in finding the component tissues of mixed voxels. Preliminary in vivo data confirm this result, and show good agreement in voxels containing pure tissue. Conclusions: The Bayesian framework and algorithm shown provide accurate solutions for the partial-volume problem in magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The flexibility of the method will allow further study into different priors and hyperpriors that can be applied in the model.},

  abstract = {Due to the limited spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET), the accuracy of quantitative measurements of regional metabolism or neuroreceptor concentration is influenced by partial volume averaging of brain with CSF, bone, and scalp. This effect is increased in the presence of cortical atrophy, as in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Correction for this underestimation in PET measurements is necessary for the comparison of AD patients and normal controls. We have developed a method for three-dimensional correction of human PET data using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A composite brain tissue image is created by summing the binary representation of nine MR images, weighted to the PET z-axis line-spread function. This composite tissue image is convolved to the resolution of the PET image. The original PET image is divided by the convolved tissue image on a pixel-by-pixel basis, resulting in an atrophy-corrected PET image in which count density represents activity per volume of brain tissue rather than spatial volume. This has been performed in [11C]carfentanil mu-opiate receptor PET studies of the temporal cortex in two AD patients and one normal volunteer. After correction, average regional increases in count density were 11\% (range = 4-21\%) in the normal and 46\% (range = 28-99\%) and 48\% (range = 14-109\%) in the patient studies. The accuracy of this method of partial volume correction was estimated using a spherical phantom.},

  abstract = {Partial volume and mixed tissue sampling errors can cause significant inaccuracy in quantitative positron emission tomographic (PET) measurements. We previously described a method of correcting PET data for the effects of partial volume averaging on gray matter (GM) quantitation; however, this method may incompletely correct GM structures when local tissue concentrations are highly heterogeneous. We have extended this three- compartment algorithm to include a fourth compartment: a GM volume of interest (VOI) that can be delineated on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Computer simulations of PET images created from human MR data demonstrated errors of up to 120\% in assigned activity values in small brain structures in uncorrected data. Four-compartment correction achieved full recovery of a wide range of coded activity in GM VOIs such as the amygdala, caudate, and thalamus. Further validation was performed in an agarose brain phantom in actual PET acquisitions. Implementation of this partial volume correction approach in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [11C]-carfentanil PET data acquired in a healthy elderly human subject was also performed. This newly developed MR-based partial volume correction algorithm permits the accurate determination of the true radioactivity concentration in specific structures that can be defined by MR by accounting for the influence of heterogeneity of GM radioactivity.},

  abstract = {Many methods have been proposed for tissue segmentation in brain MRI scans. The multitude of methods proposed complicates the choice of one method above others. We have therefore established the MRBrainS online evaluation framework for evaluating (semi)automatic algorithms that segment gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on 3T brain MRI scans of elderly subjects (65-80 y). Participants apply their algorithms to the provided data, after which their results are evaluated and ranked. Full manual segmentations of GM, WM, and CSF are available for all scans and used as the reference standard. Five datasets are provided for training and fifteen for testing. The evaluated methods are ranked based on their overall performance to segment GM, WM, and CSF and evaluated using three evaluation metrics (Dice, H95, and AVD) and the results are published on the MRBrainS13 website. We present the results of eleven segmentation algorithms that participated in the MRBrainS13 challenge workshop at MICCAI, where the framework was launched, and three commonly used freeware packages: FreeSurfer, FSL, and SPM. The MRBrainS evaluation framework provides an objective and direct comparison of all evaluated algorithms and can aid in selecting the best performing method for the segmentation goal at hand.},

ROC methodology provides the only known basis for distinguishing between these two aspects of diagnostic performance. After identifying the fundamental issues that motivate ROC analysis, this article develops ROC concepts in an intuitive way. The requirements of a valid ROC study and practical techniques for ROC data collection and data analysis are sketched briefly.

We present a consistent derivation of these first and second order differential properties using averaging Voronoi cells and the mixed Finite-Element/Finite-Volume method, and compare them to existing formulations. Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing, enhancement, and quality checking, and show results of denoising in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},

Sequences that account for such variability may improve the reliability of ASL and therefore make the technique well suited for future clinical and experimental investigations of cerebral perfusion. This study assessed the within- and between-session reproducibility of an optimized pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) sequence that incorporates multiple postlabeling delays (multi-PLD pCASL). Healthy subjects underwent four identical scans separated by 30 minutes, 1 week, and 1 month using multi-PLD pCASL to image absolute perfusion (cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial arrival time (AAT)) during both rest and a visual-cued motor task. We show good test-retest reliability, with strong consistency across subjects and sessions during rest (inter-session within-subject coefficient of variation: gray matter (GM) CBF=6.44\%; GM AAT=2.20\%). We also report high sensitivity and reproducibility during the functional task, where we show robust task-related decreases in AAT corresponding with regions of increased CBF. Importantly, these results give insight into optimal PLD selection for future investigations using single-PLD ASL to image different brain regions, and highlight the necessity of multi-PLD ASL when imaging perfusion in the whole brain.},

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop a robust renal arterial spin labeling (ASL) acquisition and processing strategy for mapping renal blood flow (RBF) in a pediatric cohort with severe kidney disease. Methods A single-shot background-suppressed 3D gradient and spin-echo (GRASE) flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL acquisition method was used to perform 2 studies. First, an evaluation of the feasibility of single-shot 3D-GRASE and retrospective noise reduction methods was performed in healthy volunteers. Second, a pediatric cohort with severe chronic kidney disease underwent single-shot 3D-GRASE FAIR ASL and RBF was quantified following several retrospective motion correction pipelines, including image registration and threshold-free weighted averaging. The effect of motion correction on the fit errors of saturation recovery (SR) images (required for RBF quantification) and on the perfusion-weighted image (PWI) temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) was evaluated, as well as the intra- and inter-session repeatability of renal longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and RBF. Results The mean cortical and/or functional renal parenchyma RBF in healthy volunteers and CKD patients was 295 {$\pm$} 97 and 95 {$\pm$} 47 mL/100 g/min, respectively. Motion-correction reduced image artefacts in both T1 and RBF maps, significantly reduced SR fit errors, significantly increased the PWI tSNR and improved the improved the repeatability of T1 and RBF in the pediatric patient cohort. Conclusion Single-shot 3D-GRASE ASL combined with retrospective motion correction enabled repeatable non-invasive RBF mapping in the first pediatric cohort with severe kidney disease undergoing ASL scans.},

Able to deliver adequately heated and humidified medical gas at flows up to 60 L/min, it is considered to have a number of physiological advantages compared with other standard oxygen therapies, including reduced anatomical dead space, PEEP, constant FIO2, and good humidification. Although few large randomized clinical trials have been performed, HFNC has been gaining attention as an alternative respiratory support for critically ill patients. Published data are mostly available for neonates. For critically ill adults, however, evidence is uneven because the reports cover various subjects with diverse underlying conditions, such as hypoxemic respiratory failure, exacerbation of COPD, postextubation, preintubation oxygenation, sleep apnea, acute heart failure, and conditions entailing do-not-intubate orders. Even so, across the diversity, many published reports suggest that HFNC decreases breathing frequency and work of breathing and reduces the need for respiratory support escalation. Some important issues remain to be resolved, such as definitive indications for HFNC and criteria for timing the starting and stopping of HFNC and for escalating treatment. Despite these issues, HFNC has emerged as an innovative and effective modality for early treatment of adults with respiratory failure with diverse underlying diseases.}

Visually unimportant features such as tubes and holes may be eliminated from a model by the open and close morphological operators. Our simplification approach accepts polygonal models as input, scan converts these to create a volumetric description, performs topology modification, and then converts the results back to polygons.

  abstract = {Renal perfusion provides the driving pressure for glomerular filtration and delivers the oxygen and nutrients to fuel solute reabsorption. Renal ischaemia is a major mechanism in acute kidney injury and may promote the progression of chronic kidney disease. Thus, quantifying renal tissue perfusion is critically important for both clinicians and physiologists. Current reference techniques for assessing renal tissue perfusion have significant limitations. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that uses magnetic labelling of water in arterial blood as an endogenous tracer to generate maps of absolute regional perfusion without requiring exogenous contrast. The technique holds enormous potential for clinical use but remains restricted to research settings. This statement paper from the PARENCHIMA network briefly outlines the ASL technique and reviews renal perfusion data in 53 studies published in English through January 2018. Renal perfusion by ASL has been validated against reference methods and has good reproducibility. Renal perfusion by ASL reduces with age and excretory function. Technical advancements mean that a renal ASL study can acquire a whole kidney perfusion measurement in less than 5\textendash 10 min. The short acquisition time permits combination with other MRI techniques that might inform drug mechanisms and renal physiology. The flexibility of renal ASL has yielded several variants of the technique, but there are limited data comparing these approaches. We make recommendations for acquiring and reporting renal ASL data and outline the knowledge gaps that future research should address.},

  abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques are gaining popularity for visualizing and quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a range of patient groups. However, most ASL methods lack vessel-selective information, which is important for the assessment of collateral flow and the arterial supply to lesions. In this study, we explored the use of vessel-encoded pseudocontinuous ASL (VEPCASL) with multiple postlabeling delays to obtain individual quantitative CBF and bolus arrival time maps for each of the four main brain-feeding arteries and compared the results against those obtained with conventional pseudocontinuous ASL (PCASL) using matched scan time. Simulations showed that PCASL systematically underestimated CBF by up to 37\% in voxels supplied by two arteries, whereas VEPCASL maintained CBF accuracy since each vascular component is treated separately. Experimental results in healthy volunteers showed that there is no systematic bias in the CBF estimates produced by VEPCASL and that the signal-to-noise ratio of the two techniques is comparable. Although more complex acquisition and image processing is required and the potential for motion sensitivity is increased, VEPCASL provides comparable data to PCASL but with the added benefit of vessel-selective information. This could lead to more accurate CBF estimates in patients with a significant collateral flow. \textcopyright{} 2013 ISCBFM.},

  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain MR images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted MR images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called FIRST, is currently distributed with the freely-available FSL package.},

Polygonal solid models obtained from a CAD system or 3D scanning are converted into voxel format with a maximum resolution of 1000 (overall volume of 1 billion voxels) in less than 2 minutes. Near realtime visualization of the voxel model is achieved by direct point rendering using a look-up table based on a finite set of neighbour voxel configurations. This gives better images than simple cube face display that has blocky appearance. Geometric computation functions have been developed to perform thickness analysis in terms of cross-sectional visualisation, progressive skin removal and radiography with minimum, maximum and total thickness along an orthographic direction. Testing of the algorithms for intricate shapes like a Ganesha idol, pelvic bone and cylinder block gave satisfactory results. The voxel based framework can be coupled to a standard CAD system, providing additional capabilities to product designers.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright 2018 Elsevier B.V. Background and purpose: To compare the structural and hemodynamic changes of healthy brain tissue in the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the tumor following photon and proton radiochemotherapy. Materials and methods: Sixty-seven patients (54.9 {$\pm$}14.0 years) diagnosed with glioblastoma undergoing adjuvant photon (n = 47) or proton (n = 19) radiochemotherapy with temozolomide after tumor resection underwent T1-weighted and arterial spin labeling MRI. Changes in volume and perfusion before and 3 to 6 months after were compared between therapies. Results: A decrease in gray matter (GM) (-2.2\%, P {$<$}0.001) and white matter (WM) (-1.2\%, P {$<$}0.001) volume was observed in photon-therapy patients compared to the pre-radiotherapy baseline. In contrast, for the proton-therapy group, no significant differences in GM (0.3\%, P = 0.64) or WM (-0.4\%, P = 0.58) volume were observed. GM volume decreased with 0.9\% per 10 Gy dose increase (P {$<$}0.001) and differed between the radiation modalities (P {$<$}0.001). Perfusion decreased in photon-therapy patients (-10.1\%, P = 0.002), whereas the decrease in proton-therapy patients, while comparable in magnitude, did not reach statistical significance (-9.1\%, P = 0.12). There was no correlation between perfusion decrease and either dose (P = 0.64) or radiation modality (P = 0.94). Conclusions: Our results show that the tissue volume decrease depends on radiation dose delivered to the healthy hemisphere and differs between treatment modalities. In contrast, the decrease in perfusion was comparable for both irradiation modalities. We conclude that proton therapy may reduce brain-volume loss when compared to photon therapy.},

We categorized these studies based on the following neuroimaging modalities (and sub-categorized based on features extracted as a post-processing step from these modalities): i) structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] (tissue density, cortical surface, and hippocampal measurements), ii) functional MRI (functional coherence of different brain regions, and the strength of the functional connectivity), iii) diffusion tensor imaging (patterns along the white matter fibers), iv) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (metabolic rate of cerebral glucose), and v) amyloid-PET (amyloid burden). The studies reviewed indicate that the classification frameworks formulated on the basis of these features show promise for individualized diagnosis and prediction of clinical progression. Finally, we provided a detailed account of AD classification challenges and addressed some future research directions.},

We then present the family of segmentations induced by the nodal sets of the eigenfunctions, discussing its meaningfulness for shape understanding.},

  abstract = {Background: Magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that structural brain abnormalities are present in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Most previous studies have focused on brain tissue volumes, but advances in neuroimaging data processing have made it possible to separate cortical area and cortical thickness. The purpose of the present study was to provide a more complete picture of cortical morphometric differences in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, decomposing cortical volume into its constituent parts, cortical thickness and cortical area. Methods: We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging images from a sample of 173 patients with schizophrenia, 139 patients with bipolar disorder, and 207 healthy control subjects. Maps of cortical volume, area, and thickness across the continuous cortical surface were generated within groups and compared between the groups. Results: There were widespread reductions in cortical volume in schizophrenia relative to healthy control subjects and patients with bipolar disorder type I. These reductions were mainly driven by cortical thinning, but there were also cortical area reductions in more circumscribed regions, which contributed to the observed volume reductions. Conclusions: The current surface-based methodology allows for a distinction between cortical thinning and reduction in cortical area and reveals that cortical thinning is the most important factor in volume reduction in schizophrenia. Cortical area reduction was not observed in bipolar disorder type I and may be unique to schizophrenia. \textcopyright{} 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

There is an increasing amount of high quality data available. However, establishing how different modalities correlate across groups remains an open research question. One reason for this is that the current methods for registration, based on cortical folding, provide sub-optimal alignment of some functional sub-regions of the brain. A more flexible framework is needed that will allow robust alignment of multiple modalities. We adapt the Fast Primal-Dual (Fast-PD) approach for discrete Markov Random Field (MRF) optimisation to spherical registration by reframing the deformation labels as a discrete set of rotations and propose a novel regularisation term, derived from the geodesic distance between rotation matrices. This formulation allows significant flexibility in the choice of similarity metric. To this end we propose a new multivariate cost function based on the discretisation of a graph-based mutual information measure. Results are presented for alignment driven by scalar metrics of curvature and myelination, and multivariate features derived from functional task performance. These experiments demonstrate the potential of this approach for improving the integration of complementary brain data sets in the future. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Surface-based cortical registration methods that are driven by geometrical features, such as folding, provide sub-optimal alignment of many functional areas due to variable correlation between cortical folding patterns and function. This has led to the proposal of new registration methods using features derived from functional and diffusion imaging. However, as yet there is no consensus over the best set of features for optimal alignment of brain function. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of a new Multimodal Surface Matching (MSM) algorithm capable of driving alignment using a wide variety of descriptors of brain architecture, function and connectivity. The versatility of the framework originates from adapting the discrete Markov Random Field (MRF) registration method to surface alignment. This has the benefit of being very flexible in the choice of a similarity measure and relatively insensitive to local minima. The method offers significant flexibility in the choice of feature set, and we demonstrate the advantages of this by performing registrations using univariate descriptors of surface curvature and myelination, multivariate feature sets derived from resting fMRI, and multimodal descriptors of surface curvature and myelination. We compare the results with two state of the art surface registration methods that use geometric features: FreeSurfer and Spherical Demons. In the future, the MSM technique will allow explorations into the best combinations of features and alignment strategies for inter-subject alignment of cortical functional areas for a wide range of neuroimaging data sets. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

However, human subjects have considerable variation in cortical folding, and in the location of functional areas relative to these folds. This makes alignment of cortical areas a challenging problem. The Multimodal Surface Matching (MSM) tool is a flexible, spherical registration approach that enables accurate registration of surfaces based on a variety of different features. Using MSM, we have previously shown that driving cross-subject surface alignment, using areal features, such as resting state-networks and myelin maps, improves group task fMRI statistics and map sharpness. However, the initial implementation of MSM's regularisation function did not penalize all forms of surface distortion evenly. In some cases, this allowed peak distortions to exceed neurobiologically plausible limits, unless regularisation strength was increased to a level which prevented the algorithm from fully maximizing surface alignment. Here we propose and implement a new regularisation penalty, derived from physically relevant equations of strain (deformation) energy, and demonstrate that its use leads to improved and more robust alignment of multimodal imaging data. In addition, since spherical warps incorporate projection distortions that are unavoidable when mapping from a convoluted cortical surface to the sphere, we also propose constraints that enforce smooth deformation of cortical anatomies. We test the impact of this approach for longitudinal modelling of cortical development for neonates (born between 31 and 43 weeks of post-menstrual age) and demonstrate that the proposed method increases the biological interpretability of the distortion fields and improves the statistical significance of population-based analysis relative to other spherical methods.},

  abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {The most prevalent approach to activation localization in neuroimaging is to identify brain regions as contiguous supra-threshold clusters, check their significance using random field theory, and correct for the multiple clusters being tested. Besides recent criticism on the validity of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies ``there exists at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster'', and not that ``all the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response''. Inference on voxels within selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high, the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further ``drill down'' from the cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small, however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox, and its resolution using ARI. We verify that the endless circularity permitted by ARI does not render its estimates overly conservative using both simulation, and a data split.},

  abstract = {Objective: The spatial heterogeneity of renal perfusion data was analyzed with arterial spin labeling (ASL) data sets in a cohort of subjects with moderately impaired kidney function (ie, glomerular filtration rate 930 mL/min/1.73 m2) versus a cohort of healthy volunteers. The potential diagnostic value of a detailed histogram analysis of such perfusion data for detection of mild renal dysfunction was investigated. Materials and Methods: Eight healthy volunteers and 9 patients with mild renal dysfunction (chronic kidney disease stages 1-3) were included in the study. All subjects underwent ASL perfusion measurements with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery labeling scheme with true fast imaging in steady-state precession data readout. Quantitative perfusion maps were generated using extended Bloch equations. Histogram analysis was performed to quantify the metrics of the perfusion of the renal cortex and the entire parenchyma, respectively. Mean perfusion value (K), SD of the mean value (R), peak height (PH), peak position (PP), skewness (s), and kurtosis (k) were computed to describe the distribution of the perfusion values. Results: A significant difference was found in the mean perfusion values computed for the cortex and the parenchyma between healthy volunteers (cortex, 329 T 53 mL/100 g/min; parenchyma, 301 T 51 mL/100 g/min) and patients (cortex, 263 T 81 mL/100 g/min; parenchyma, 244 T 77 mL/100 g/min). The histogram analysis of the cortical perfusion values also showed a significant difference (P G 0.05) in the main histogram measures between healthy volunteers (PP = 368 T 65 mL/100 g/min; s = j0.543 T 0.298; k = 0.371 T 0.590) and patients (PP = 237 T 115 mL/100 g/min; s = j0.125 T 0.581; k = j0.151 T 0.561). Conclusion: Moderate renal dysfunction is associated with a significant change in the distribution of cortical perfusion values and a reduction of blood perfusion for both the parenchyma and the cortex. The preliminary results reported in this study suggest the importance of a regional assessment of renal perfusion. Histogram analysis of ASL data may help to detect chronic kidney disorders and to monitor their progression in a clinical setting.},

The general technique utilizes a statistical model of the noise and partial volume effect together with a finite mixture density description of the tissues. The quantification is then formulated as a minimization problem of high order with up to six separate densities as part of the mixture. This problem is solved by tree annealing with and without partial volume utilized, the results compared, and the sensitivity of the tree annealing algorithm to various parameters is exhibited. The actual quantification is performed by two methods: a classification-based method called Bayes quantification, and parameter estimation.

This method automatically and objectively outlines area borders because adjacent areas often have the opposite field sign. Cortical magnification factor curves for striate and extrastriate cortical areas were determined, which showed that human visual areas have a greater emphasis on the center-of-gaze than their counterparts in monkeys.

Recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have shown potential in differentiating between myeloarchitectonically distinct cortical regions in vivo. Here we introduce a new algorithm for correcting partial volume effects present in mm-scale MRI images which was used to investigate the myelination pattern of the cerebral cortex in 1555 clinically normal subjects using the ratio of T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI images. A significant linear cross-sectional age increase in T1w/T2w estimated myelin was detected across an 18 to 35. year age span (highest value of \textasciitilde{} 1\%/year compared to mean T1w/T2w myelin value at 18 years). The cortex was divided at mid-thickness and the value of T1w/T2w myelin calculated for the inner and outer layers separately. The increase in T1w/T2w estimated myelin occurs predominantly in the inner layer for most cortical regions. The ratio of the inner and outer layer T1w/T2w myelin was further validated using high-resolution in vivo MRI scans and also a high-resolution MRI scan of a postmortem brain. Additionally, the relationships between cortical thickness, curvature and T1w/T2w estimated myelin were found to be significant, although the relationships varied across the cortex. We discuss these observations as well as limitations of using the T1w/T2w ratio as an estimate of cortical myelin.},

Facilities include hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and assisted living centers and may be located throughout a wide geographic area. To date, the problem of constructing weekly schedules for the therapists has yet to be fully investigated. This article presents the first algorithm for supporting weekly planning at the agencies that do the contracting. The goal is to better match patient demand with therapist skills while minimizing treatment, travel, administrative and mileage reimbursement costs. The problem was modeled as a mixed-integer program but has several complicating components, including different patient classes, optional weekly treatment patterns and a complex payment structure that frustrated the use of exact methods. Alternatively, a parallel (two-phase) greedy randomized adaptive search procedure was developed that relies on an innovative decomposition scheme and a number of benefit measures that explicitly address the trade-off between feasibility and solution quality. In Phase I, daily routes are constructed for the therapists in parallel and then combined to form weekly schedules. In Phase II, a high-level neighborhood search is executed to converge towards a local optimum. This is facilitated by solving a series of newly formulated traveling salesman problems with side constraints. Extensive testing with both real data provided by a U.S. rehabilitation agency and associated random instances demonstrates the effectiveness of the purposed procedure. \textcopyright{} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {We describe a sequence of low-level operations to isolate and classify brain tissue within T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Our method first removes nonbrain tissue using a combination of anisotropic diffusion filtering, edge detection, and mathematical morphology. We compensate for image non-uniformities due to magnetic field inhomogeneities by fitting a tricubic B-spline gain field to local estimates of the image nonuniformity spaced throughout the MRI volume. The local estimates are computed by fitting a partial volume tissue measurement model to histograms of neighborhoods about each estimate point. The measurement model uses mean tissue intensity and noise variance values computed from the global image and a multiplicative bias parameter that is estimated for each region during the histogram fit. Voxels in the intensity-normalized image are then classified into six tissue types using a maximum a posteriori classifier. This classifier combines the partial volume tissue measurement model with a Gibbs prior that models the spatial properties of the brain. We validate each stage of our algorithm on real and phantom data. Using data from the 20 normal MRI brain data sets of the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository, our method achieved average {$\kappa$} indices of {$\kappa$} = 0.746 {$\pm$} 0.114 for gray matter (GM) and {$\kappa$} = 0.798 {$\pm$} 0.089 for white matter (WM) compared to expert labeled data.

Algorithm developers require this so they can see where methods need to be improved and see how new developments compare with existing ones. Users of algorithms also need to understand the characteristics of algorithms when they select and apply them to their neuroimaging analysis applications. Many metrics have been proposed to characterize error and success rates in segmentation, and several datasets have also been made public for evaluation. Still, the methodologies used in analyzing and reporting these results vary from study to study, so even when studies use the same metrics their numerical results may not necessarily be directly comparable. To address this problem, we developed a web-based resource for evaluating the performance of skull-stripping in T1-weighted MRI. The resource provides both the data to be segmented and an online application that performs a validation study on the data. Users may download the test dataset, segment it using whichever method they wish to assess, and upload their segmentation results to the server. The server computes a series of metrics, displays a detailed report of the validation results, and archives these for future browsing and analysis. We applied this framework to the evaluation of 3 popular skull-stripping algorithms - the Brain Extraction Tool [Smith, S.M., 2002. Fast robust automated brain extraction. Hum. Brain Mapp. 17 (3),143-155 (Nov)], the Hybrid Watershed Algorithm [S\'egonne, F., Dale, A.M., Busa, E., Glessner, M., Salat, D., Hahn, H.K., Fischl, B., 2004.

However, the network of anatomical connections linking the neuronal elements of the human brain is still largely unknown. While some databases or collations of large-scale anatomical connection patterns exist for other mammalian species, there is currently no connection matrix of the human brain, nor is there a coordinated research effort to collect, archive, and disseminate this important information.

  abstract = {Background Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and related disorders, along with the development of novel candidate disease modifying treatments, have stimulated the need for tools to assess the efficacy of new therapies. While perfusion imaging by arterial spin labeling (ASL) is an attractive approach for longitudinal imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration, sources of variability between sessions including arterial transit times (ATT) and fluctuations in resting perfusion can reduce its sensitivity. Establishing the magnitude of perfusion changes that can be reliably detected is necessary to delineate longitudinal perfusion changes related to disease processes from the effects of these sources of error. Purpose To assess the feasibility of ASL for longitudinal monitoring of patients with FTD by quantifying between-session variability of perfusion on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Methods and materials ASL data were collected in 13 healthy controls and 8 patients with FTD or progressive supra-nuclear palsy. Variability in cerebral blood flow (CBF) by single delay pseudo-continuous ASL (SD-pCASL) acquired one month apart were quantified by the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Additionally, CBF by SD-pCASL and ATT by low-resolution multiple inversion time ASL (LowRes-pCASL) were compared to Hadamard encoded sequences which are able to simultaneously measure CBF and ATT with improved time-efficiency. Results Agreement of grey-matter perfusion between sessions was found for both patients and controls (CV~=~10.8\% and 8.3\% respectively) with good reliability for both groups (ICC~{$>~$}0.6). Intensity normalization to remove day-to-day fluctuations in resting perfusion reduced the CV by 28\%. Less than 5\% of voxels had ATTs above the chosen post labelling delay (2~s), indicating that the ATT was not a significant source of error. Hadamard-encoded perfusion imaging yielded systematically higher CBF compared to SD-pCASL, but produced similar transit-time measurements. Power analysis revealed that SD-pCASL has the sensitivity to detect longitudinal changes as low as 10\% with as few as 10 patient participants. Conclusion With the appropriate labeling parameters, SD-pCASL is a promising approach for assessing longitudinal changes in CBF associated with FTD.},

  abstract = {Purpose: When using simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) EPI for background suppressed (BGS) arterial spin labeling (ASL), correction of through-plane motion could introduce artefacts, because the slices with most effective BGS are adjacent to slices with the least BGS. In this study, a new framework is presented to correct for such artefacts. Methods: The proposed framework consists of 3 steps: (1) homogenization of the static tissue signal over the different slices to eliminate most inter-slice differences because of different levels of BGS, (2) application of motion correction, and (3) extraction of a perfusion-weighted signal using a general linear model. The proposed framework was evaluated by simulations and a functional ASL study with intentional head motion. Results: Simulation studies demonstrated that the strong signal differences between slices with the most and least effective BGS caused sub-optimal estimation of motion parameters when through-plane motion was present. Although use of the M0 image as the reference for registration allowed 82\% improvement of motion estimation for through-plane motion, it still led to residual subtraction errors caused by different static tissue signal between control and label because of different BGS levels. By using our proposed framework, those problems were minimized, and the accuracy of CBF estimation was improved. Moreover, the functional ASL study showed improved detection of visual and motor activation when applying the framework as compared to conventional motion correction, as well as when motion correction was completely omitted. Conclusion: When combining BGS-ASL with SMS-EPI, particular attention is needed to avoid artefacts introduced by motion correction. With the proposed framework, these issues are minimized.},

  abstract = {Rationale Clinical trials are the gold standard for testing interventions. COVID-19 has further raised their public profile and emphasised the need to deliver better, faster, more efficient trials for patient benefit. Considerable overlap exists between data required for trials and data already collected routinely in electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Opportunities exist to use these in innovative ways to decrease duplication of effort and speed trial recruitment, conduct and follow-up. Approach The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Health Data Research UK and Clinical Practice Research Datalink co-organised a national workshop to accelerate the agenda for data-enabled clinical trials'. Showcasing successful examples and imagining future possibilities, the plenary talks, panel discussions, group discussions and case studies covered: design/feasibility; recruitment; conduct/follow-up; collecting benefits/harms; and analysis/interpretation. Reflection Some notable studies have successfully accessed and used EHR to identify potential recruits, support randomised trials, deliver interventions and supplement/replace trial-specific follow-up. Some outcome measures are already reliably collected; others, like safety, need detailed work to meet regulatory reporting requirements. There is a clear need for system interoperability and a route map' to identify and access the necessary datasets. Researchers running regulatory-facing trials must carefully consider how data quality and integrity would be assessed. An experience-sharing forum could stimulate wider adoption of EHR-based methods in trial design and execution. Discussion EHR offer opportunities to better plan clinical trials, assess patients and capture data more efficiently, reducing research waste and increasing focus on each trial's specific challenges. The short-term emphasis should be on facilitating patient recruitment and for postmarketing authorisation trials where research-relevant outcome measures are readily collectable. Sharing of case studies is encouraged. The workshop directly informed NIHR's funding call for ambitious data-enabled trials at scale. There is the opportunity for the UK to build upon existing data science capabilities to identify, recruit and monitor patients in trials at scale.},

These ventilators may rapidly deplete oxygen cylinders, especially in patients with decreased pulmonary compliance. Our goal in this study was to determine oxygen consumption rates with a contemporary FAM in models of high (HC) and low (LC) pulmonary compliance. Oxygen consumption rates were tested using D cylin-ders (initial pressure 1700 psig) and the Narkomed\textregistered{} M FAM, which uses an air injector to decrease compressed gas consumption by entraining room air as part of the drive gas. Three different tidal volumes (VT) were tested (500, 750, and 1000 mL) with HC and LC lung models, and the fresh gas flow rate was 1 L/min. Respiratory rate was constant at 10 breaths/min. Oxygen consumption varied directly with VT and inversely with compliance, increasing from 4.8 {$\pm$} 0.07 L/min with the HC-500 mL VT model to 6.2 {$\pm$} 0.05 L/min with the LC-1000 mL VT model. D cylinder duration ranged from 56.8 {$\pm$} 0.4 to 73.6 {$\pm$} 1.0 minutes. Assuming oxygen fresh gas flow of 1 L/min, calculating tank duration with the fastest consumption rate underestimated the tank duration for more compliant and smaller VT models but provided a greater margin of patient safety. \textcopyright 2005 by the International Anesthesia Research Society.},

We introduce the hMRI-toolbox, an open-source, easy-to-use tool available on GitHub, for qMRI data handling and processing, presented together with a tutorial and example dataset. This toolbox allows the estimation of high-quality multi-parameter qMRI maps (longitudinal and effective transverse relaxation rates R 1 and R 2{$\star$} , proton density PD and magnetisation transfer MT saturation) that can be used for quantitative parameter analysis and accurate delineation of subcortical brain structures. The qMRI maps generated by the toolbox are key input parameters for biophysical models designed to estimate tissue microstructure properties such as the MR g-ratio and to derive standard and novel MRI biomarkers. Thus, the current version of the toolbox is a first step towards in vivo histology using MRI (hMRI) and is being extended further in this direction. Embedded in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) framework, it benefits from the extensive range of established SPM tools for high-accuracy spatial registration and statistical inferences and can be readily combined with existing SPM toolboxes for estimating diffusion MRI parameter maps. From a user's perspective, the hMRI-toolbox is an efficient, robust and simple framework for investigating qMRI data in neuroscience and clinical research.},

We conducted a multisample magnetic resonance imaging study to investigate the development of cortical volume, surface area, and thickness, as well as their inter-relationships, from late childhood to early adulthood (7-29 years) using four separate longitudinal samples including 388 participants and 854 total scans. These independent datasets were processed and quality-controlled using the same methods, but analyzed separately to study the replicability of the results across sample and image-acquisition characteristics. The results consistently showed widespread and regionally variable nonlinear decreases in cortical volume and thickness and comparably smaller steady decreases in surface area. Further, the dominant contributor to cortical volume reductions during adolescence was thinning. Finally, complex regional and topological patterns of associations between changes in surface area and thickness were observed. Positive relationships were seen in sulcal regions in prefrontal and temporal cortices, while negative relationships were seen mainly in gyral regions in more posterior cortices. Collectively, these results help resolve previous inconsistencies regarding the structural development of the cerebral cortex from childhood to adulthood, and provide novel insight into how changes in the different dimensions of the cortex in this period of life are inter-related.},

However, recent work with high-resolution MRI has emphasized the regional and depth-dependent structural, functional and relaxation times variations within the cortex. Using high-resolution Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) and T1 mapping acquisitions, we sought to probe the effects of spatial resolution and tissue heterogeneity on cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements with ASL. We acquired high-resolution (1.6mm)3 whole brain ASL data in a cohort of 10 volunteers at 3T, along with T1 and transit-time (ATT) mapping, followed by group cortical surface-based analysis using FreeSurfer of the different measured parameters. Fully resolved regional analysis showed higher than average mid-thickness CBF in primary motor areas (+15\%,p{$<$}0.002), frontal regions (+17\%,p{$<$}0.01) and auditory cortex, while occipital regions had lower average CBF (-20\%,p{$<$}10?5). ASL signal was higher towards the pial surface but correction for the shorter T1 near the white matter surface reverses this gradient, at least when using the low-resolution ATT map. Similar to structural measures, fully-resolved ASL CBF measures show significant differences across cortical regions. Depth-dependent variation of T1 in the cortex complicates interpretation of depth-dependent ASL signal and may have implications for the accurate CBF quantification at lower resolutions.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Clinically, it is characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment with structural hallmarks of cortical atrophy and ventricular expansion. Amyloid plaque aggregation is also known to occur in AD subjects. In-vivo imaging of amyloid plaques is now possible with positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands. PET imaging suffers from a degrading phenomenon known as the partial volume effect (PVE). The quantitative accuracy of PET images is reduced by PVEs primarily due to the limited spatial resolution of the scanner. The degree of PVE is influenced by structure size, with smaller structures tending to suffer from more severe PVEs such as atrophied grey matter regions. The aims of this paper were to investigate the effect of partial volume correction (PVC) on the quantification of amyloid PET and to highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate PVC technique.},

The shifting deficits were asymmetric (left hemisphere {$>$} right hemisphere) and correlated with progressively declining cognitive status (p {$<$} 0.0006). Novel brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of atrophy in 52 high-resolution magnetic resonance image scans of 12 patients with AD (age 68.4 {$\pm$} 1.9 years) and 14 elderly matched controls (age 71.4 {$\pm$} 0.9 years) scanned longitudinally (two scans; interscan interval 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.4 years). A cortical pattern matching technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later ({$<$} 15\% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of AD and differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates (5.3 {$\pm$} 2.3\% per year in AD v 0.9 {$\pm$} 0.9\% per year in controls) were faster in the left hemisphere (p {$<$} 0.029) than the right. Transient barriers to disease progression appeared at limbic/frontal boundaries. This degenerative sequence, observed in vivo as it developed, provides the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.},

Correction for PVE requires estimates of the partial volumes (PVs) present in an image. These estimates are conventionally obtained via volumetric segmentation, but such an approach may not be accurate for complex structures such as the cortex. An alternative is to use surface-based segmentation, which is well-established within the literature. Toblerone is a new method for estimating PVs using such surfaces. It uses a purely geometric approach that considers the intersection between a surface and the voxels of an image. In contrast to existing surface-based techniques, Toblerone is not restricted to use with any particular structure or modality. Evaluation in a neuroimaging context has been performed on simulated surfaces, simulated T1-weighted MRI images and finally a Human Connectome Project test-retest dataset. A comparison has been made to two existing surface-based methods; in all analyses Toblerone's performance either matched or surpassed the comparator methods. Evaluation results also show that compared to an existing volumetric method (FSL FAST), a surface-based approach with Toblerone offers improved robustness to scanner noise and field non-uniformity, and better inter-session repeatability in brain volume. In contrast to volumetric methods, a surface-based approach negates the need to perform resampling which is advantageous at the resolutions typically used for neuroimaging.},

Partial volume estimation, that is, the estimation of the amount of each tissue type within each voxel, has received considerable interest in recent years. Much of this work has been focused on the mixel model, a statistical model of PVE. We propose a novel trimmed minimum covariance determinant (TMCD) method for the estimation of the parameters of the mixel PVE model. In this method, each voxel is first labeled according to the most dominant tissue type. Voxels that are prone to PVE are removed from this labeled set, following which robust location estimators with high breakdown points are used to estimate the mean and the covariance of each tissue class. Comparisons between different methods for parameter estimation based on classified images as well as expectation-maximization-like (EM-like) procedure for simultaneous parameter and partial volume estimation are reported. The robust estimators based on a pruned classification as presented here are shown to perform well even if the initial classification is of poor quality. The results obtained are comparable to those obtained using the EM-like procedure, but require considerably less computation time. Segmentation results of real data based on partial volume estimation are also reported. In addition to considering the parameter estimation problem, we discuss differences between different approximations to the complete mixel model. In summary, the proposed TMCD method allows for the accurate, robust, and efficient estimation of partial volume model parameters, which is crucial to a variety of brain MRI data analysis procedures such as the accurate estimation of tissue volumes and the accurate delineation of the cortical surface. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Being able to detect reliably functional activity in a population of subjects is crucial in human brain mapping, both for the understanding of cognitive functions in normal subjects and for the analysis of patient data. The usual approach proceeds by normalizing brain volumes to a common three-dimensional template. However, a large part of the data acquired in fMRI aims at localizing cortical activity, and methods working on the cortical surface may provide better inter-subject registration than the standard procedures that process the data in the volume. Nevertheless, few assessments of the performance of surface-based (2D) versus volume-based (3D) procedures have been shown so far, mostly because inter-subject cortical surface maps are not easily obtained. In this paper we present a systematic comparison of 2D versus 3D group-level inference procedures, by using cluster-level and voxel-level statistics assessed by permutation, in random effects (RFX) and mixed-effects analyses (MFX). We consider different schemes to perform meaningful comparisons between thresholded statistical maps in the volume and on the cortical surface. We find that surface-based multi-subject statistical analyses are generally more sensitive than their volume-based counterpart, in the sense that they detect slightly denser networks of regions when performing peak-level detection; this effect is less clear for cluster-level inference and is reduced by smoothing. Surface-based inference also increases the reliability of the activation maps. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

To fully characterize this area, high spatial resolution is essential, including the use of very thin image slices to avoid loss of definition due to partial volume effects. A three-dimensional magnetization-prepared turbo spin-echo sequence, with appropriate parameter optimization, provided high-resolution imaging (0.4??0.4??0.5 mm3) on a clinical 3-T scanner with adequate contrast to noise ratio. These images allowed visualisation of the stria of Gennari in every slice of a volume covering most of the occipital cortex, in each of six healthy volunteers. The effective longitudinal relaxation time was measured with the isotropic resolution turbo spin echo sequence and found to be substantially shorter than values measured with a dedicated relaxometric sequence. The shortening was attributed to magnetization transfer effects, as supported by the investigation of its slab and turbo-factor dependence. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) relies primarily on three complementary magnetic resonance (MR) methods. These are: 1) resting state functional MR imaging (rfMRI) which uses correlations in the temporal fluctuations in an fMRI time series to deduce '. functional connectivity'; 2) diffusion imaging (dMRI), which provides the input for tractography algorithms used for the reconstruction of the complex axonal fiber architecture; and 3) task based fMRI (tfMRI), which is employed to identify functional parcellation in the human brain in order to assist analyses of data obtained with the first two methods. We describe technical improvements and optimization of these methods as well as instrumental choices that impact speed of acquisition of fMRI and dMRI images at 3. T, leading to whole brain coverage with 2. mm isotropic resolution in 0.7. s for fMRI, and 1.25. mm isotropic resolution dMRI data for tractography analysis with three-fold reduction in total dMRI data acquisition time. Ongoing technical developments and optimization for acquisition of similar data at 7. T magnetic field are also presented, targeting higher spatial resolution, enhanced specificity of functional imaging signals, mitigation of the inhomogeneous radio frequency (RF) fields, and reduced power deposition. Results demonstrate that overall, these approaches represent a significant advance in MR imaging of the human brain to investigate brain function and structure. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We implemented a method to register individual subjects to a hybrid version of the FreeSurfer "fsaverage" atlas whose left and right hemispheres are in precise geographic correspondence. Cortical folding patterns in the resultant population-average "fs\_LR" midthickness surfaces are remarkably similar in the left and right hemispheres, even in regions showing significant asymmetry in 3D position. Both hemispheres are equal in average surface area, but hotspots of surface area asymmetry are present in the Sylvian Fissure and elsewhere, together with a broad pattern of asymmetries that are significant though small in magnitude. Multiple cortical parcellation schemes registered to the human atlas provide valuable reference data sets for comparisons with other studies. Identified cortical areas vary in size by more than 2 orders of magnitude.

The hypometabolism patterns in several areas of the brain were significantly correlated with the clinical manifestations. These areas included the paralimbic regions for typical presentations of sporadic EOAD. For atypical presentations, the hypometabolic regions included Broca's and Wernicke's areas and the pulvinar in language forms, bilateral primary and higher processing visual regions (with right predominance) in visuospatial forms, and the bilateral prefrontal cortex in executive forms. Similar hypometabolism patterns were also observed in a correlation analysis of the 18F-FDG PET data versus domain-specific, neuropsychological test scores. These heterogeneities might reflect different underlying pathophysiological processes in particular clinical presentations of sporadic EOAD and should be taken into account in future longitudinal and therapeutic studies.},

In this work, a cortical surface-based projection of ASL maps was applied in patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) to improve the image quality and visual representation of perfusion data. METHODS: Eighteen patients referred from the reference centre for EOAD were assessed by MRI with ASL sequences. Data processing was applied on each examination including correction of partial volume effects and cortical projection of preprocessed ASL data. Cortical segmentation and perfusion display were qualitatively analyzed according to a three-point scale. RESULTS: All examinations were suitable for complete data processing. Quality of segmentation and of cortical surface-based perfusion maps was scored as optimal in 72 \% in both cases. Cortical surface-based ASL maps provided a more global view than single slices and an accurate approach of brain perfusion in EOAD patients. CONCLUSION: Cortical surface-based analysis of ASL maps is technically feasible with a good image quality and may enable significant improvement in the detection of focal perfusion alterations in neurodegenerative disorders in the real-life clinical setting.

In this study, we used arterial spin labeling (ASL), a noninvasive perfusion MRI sequence, and [18F]-FDG-PET to detect the perfusion and metabolic features in patients with EOAD. METHODS: All patients were investigated in the French reference center for young-onset dementia and were assessed by MRI, including a pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) sequence, and [18F]-FDG-PET. Quantitative analyses and intermodality comparison with correlation analysis were made after data processing including correction of partial volume effects, cortical projection, and specific intensity normalization. RESULTS: We prospectively included 37 patients with EOAD with a mean age of 58.3 years. The areas of most severe hypoperfusion detected with ASL were located in the parietal lobes, the precuneus, the right posterior cingulate cortex, and the frontal lobes (P {$<$} .05). The areas of lowest glucose metabolism detected by [18F]-FDG-PET were identified in the temporoparietal cortex and the precuneus (P {$<$} .05). Hypometabolic regions were more extensive than hypoperfused regions on ASL maps whereas ASL highlighted alterations in the frontal lobes without apparent hypometabolism on [18F]-FDG-PET maps. CONCLUSIONS: ASL and [18F]-FDG-PET detected pathological areas of similar distribution mainly located in the inferior parietal lobules and local zones in the temporal cortex in patients with EOAD. Our preliminary study showed that ASL and [18F]-FDG-PET may have a complementary role in combination with structural MRI for the assessment of suspected EOAD.},

Studies by Polivanova (1974, Voprosy Psikhologii, 4, 41-51) and by MacGregor and Ormerod (1996, Perception \& Psychophysics, 58, 527-539) suggest that: (1) the complexity of solutions to visually presented TSPs depends on the number of points on the convex hull; and (2) the perception of optimal structure is an innate tendency of the visual system, not subject to individual differences. Results are reported from two experiments. In the first, measures of the total length and completion speed of pathways, and a measure of path uncertainty were compared with optimal solutions produced by an elastic net algorithm and by several heuristic methods. Performance was also compared under instructions to draw the shortest or the most attractive pathway. In the second, various measures of performance were compared with scores on Raven's advanced progressive matrices (APM). The number of points on the convex hull did not determine the relative optimality of solutions, although both this factor and the total number of points influenced solution speed and path uncertainty. Subjects' solutions showed appreciable individual differences, which had a strong correlation with APM scores. The relation between perceptual organization and the process of solving visually presented TSPs is briefly discussed, as is the potential of optimization for providing a conceptual framework for the study of intelligence.},

Fine blood vessel segmentation can help build a more accurate computer-aided diagnosis system and help physicians gain a better understanding of vascular structures. The purpose of this article is to develop a blood vessel segmentation method that can improve segmentation accuracy in tiny blood vessels. In this work, we propose a tensor-based graph-cut method for blood vessel segmentation. With our method, each voxel can be modeled by a second-order tensor, allowing the capture of the intensity information and the geometric information for building a more accurate model for blood vessel segmentation. We compared our proposed method's accuracy to several state-of-the-art blood vessel segmentation algorithms and performed experiments on both simulated and clinical CT datasets. Both experiments showed that our method achieved better state-of-the-art results than the competing techniques. The mean centerline overlap ratio of our proposed method is 84\% on clinical CT data. Our proposed blood vessel segmentation method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by 10\% on clinical CT data. Tiny blood vessels in clinical CT data with a 1-mm radius can be extracted using the proposed technique. The experiments on a clinical dataset showed that the proposed method significantly improved the segmentation accuracy in tiny blood vessels.},

  abstract = {Quantitative mapping of the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1=1/T1) in the human brain enables the investigation of tissue microstructure and macroscopic morphology which are becoming increasingly important for clinical and neuroimaging applications. R1 maps are now commonly estimated from two fast high-resolution 3D FLASH acquisitions with variable excitation flip angles, because this approach is fast and does not rely on special acquisition techniques. However, these R1 maps need to be corrected for bias due to RF transmit field (B1+) inhomogeneities, requiring additional B1+ mapping which is usually time consuming and difficult to implement. We propose a technique that simultaneously estimates the B1+ inhomogeneities and R1 values from the uncorrected R1 maps in the human brain without need for B1+ mapping. It employs a probabilistic framework for unified segmentation based correction of R1 maps for B1+ inhomogeneities (UNICORT). The framework incorporates a physically informed generative model of smooth B1+ inhomogeneities and their multiplicative effect on R1 estimates. Extensive cross-validation with the established standard using measured B1+ maps shows that UNICORT yields accurate B1+ and R1 maps with a mean deviation from the standard of less than 4.3\% and 5\%, respectively. The results of different groups of subjects with a wide age range and different levels of atypical brain anatomy further suggest that the method is robust and generalizes well to wider populations. UNICORT is easy to apply, as it is computationally efficient and its basic framework is implemented as part of the tissue segmentation in SPM8. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Multi-center studies using magnetic resonance imaging facilitate studying small effect sizes, global population variance and rare diseases. The reliability and sensitivity of these multi-center studies crucially depend on the comparability of the data generated at different sites and time points. The level of inter-site comparability is still controversial for conventional anatomical T1-weighted MRI data. Quantitative multi-parameter mapping (MPM) was designed to provide MR parameter measures that are comparable across sites and time points, i.e., 1 mm high-resolution maps of the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1 = 1/T1), effective proton density (PD*), magnetization transfer saturation (MT) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2* = 1/T2*). MPM was validated at 3T for use in multi-center studies by scanning five volunteers at three different sites. We determined the inter-site bias, inter-site and intra-site coefficient of variation (CoV) for typical morphometric measures [i.e., gray matter (GM) probability maps used in voxel-based morphometry] and the four quantitative parameters. The inter-site bias and CoV were smaller than 3.1 and 8\%, respectively, except for the inter-site CoV of R2* ({$<$}20\%). The GM probability maps based on the MT parameter maps had a 14\% higher inter-site reproducibility than maps based on conventional T1-weighted images. The low inter-site bias and variance in the parameters and derived GM probability maps confirm the high comparability of the quantitative maps across sites and time points. The reliability, short acquisition time, high resolution and the detailed insights into the brain microstructure provided by MPM makes it an efficient tool for multi-center imaging studies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Weiskopf.},

  abstract = {Structural analysis of MRI data on the cortical surface usually focuses on cortical thickness. Cortical surface area, when considered, has been measured only over gross regions or approached indirectly via comparisons with a standard brain. Here we demonstrate that direct measurement and comparison of the surface area of the cerebral cortex at a fine scale is possible using mass conservative interpolation methods. We present a framework for analyses of the cortical surface area, as well as for any other measurement distributed across the cortex that is areal by nature. The method consists of the construction of a mesh representation of the cortex, registration to a common coordinate system and, crucially, interpolation using a pycnophylactic method. Statistical analysis of surface area is done with power-transformed data to address lognormality, and inference is done with permutation methods. We introduce the concept of facewise analysis, discuss its interpretation and potential applications.},

  abstract = {Mixture models are commonly used in the statistical segmentation of images. For example, they can be used for the segmentation of structural medical images into different matter types, or of statistical parametric maps into activating and nonactivating brain regions in functional imaging. Spatial mixture models have been developed to augment histogram information with spatial regularization using Markov random fields (MRFs). In previous work, an approximate model was developed to allow adaptive determination of the parameter controlling the strength of spatial regularization. Inference was performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. However, this approach is prohibitively slow for large datasets. In this work, a more efficient inference approach is presented. This combines a variational Bayes approximation with a second-order Taylor expansion of the components of the posterior distribution, which would otherwise be intractable to Variational Bayes. This provides inference on fully adaptive spatial mixture models an order of magnitude faster than MCMC. We examine the behavior of this approach when applied to artificial data \textbackslash jith different spatial characteristics, and to functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical parametric maps. \textcopyright{} 2006 IEEE.},

This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors. It allows us to extract probabilistic information from the data, and to probabilistically combine information from multiple modalities. Bayes can also be used to not only compare and select between models of different complexity, but also to infer on data using committees of models. Finally, we mention some analysis scenarios where Bayesian methods are impractical, and briefly discuss some practical approaches that we have taken in these cases.},

  abstract = {FMRI modelling requires flexible haemodynamic response function (HRF) modelling, with the HRF being allowed to vary spatially and between subjects. To achieve this flexibility, voxelwise parameterised HRFs have been proposed; however, inference on such models is very slow. An alternative approach is to use basis functions allowing inference to proceed in the more manageable General Linear Model (GLM) framework. However, a large amount of the subspace spanned by the basis functions produces nonsensical HRF shapes. In this work we propose a technique for choosing a basis set, and then the means to constrain the subspace spanned by the basis set to only include sensible HRF shapes. Penny et al. [NeuroImage (2003)] showed how Variational Bayes can be used to infer on the GLM for FMRI. Here we extend the work of Penny et al. to give inference on the GLM with constrained HRF basis functions and with spatial Markov Random Fields on the autoregressive noise parameters. Constraining the subspace spanned by the basis set allows for far superior separation of activating voxels from nonactivating voxels in FMRI data. We use spatial mixture modelling to produce final probabilities of activation and demonstrate increased sensitivity on an FMRI dataset. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Geometric distortions along the phase encoding direction caused by off-resonant spins are a major issue in EPI based functional and diffusion imaging. The widely used blip up/down approach estimates the underlying distortion field from a pair of images with inverted phase encoding direction. Typically, iterative methods are used to find a solution to the ill-posed problem of finding the displacement field that maps up/down acquisitions onto each other. Here, we explore the use of a deep convolutional network to estimate the displacement map from a pair of input images. Methods: We trained a deep convolutional U-net architecture that was previously used to estimate optic flow between moving images to learn to predict the distortion map from an input pair of distorted EPI acquisitions. During the training step, the network minimizes a loss function (similarity metric) that is calculated from corrected input image pairs. This approach does not require the explicit knowledge of the ground truth distortion map, which is difficult to get for real life data. Results: We used data from a total of Ntrain \hspace{0pt}= \hspace{0pt}22 healthy subjects to train our network. A separate dataset of Ntest \hspace{0pt}= \hspace{0pt}12 patients including some with abnormal findings and unseen acquisition modes, e.g. LR-encoding, coronal orientation) was reserved for testing and evaluation purposes. We compared our results to FSL's topup function with default parameters that served as the gold standard. We found that our approach results in a correction accuracy that is virtually identical to the optimum found by an iterative search, but with reduced computational time. Conclusion: By using a deep convolutional network, we can reduce the processing time to a few seconds per volume, which is significantly faster than iterative approaches like FSL's topup which takes around 10min on the same machine (but using only 1 CPU). This facilitates the use of a blip up/down scheme for all diffusion-weighted acquisitions and potential real-time EPI distortion correction without sacrificing accuracy.},

Methods: Patients with MS (n = 16) and controls (n = 80) matched for age, sex, and APOE {$\epsilon$}4 status from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVrs) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations with age. Results: AD signature PiB SUVr (odds ratio [OR] [95\% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.52 [0.27\textendash 0.98], p = 0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR [95\% CI] = 0.52 [0.28\textendash 0.99], p = 0.048), and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR [95\% CI] = 0.10 [0.01\textendash 0.90], p = 0.040) were lower in MS than controls. Although AD-signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR [95\% CI] = 10.65 [1.10\textendash 103.35], p = 0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95\% CI] = -0.14 [-0.023 to -0.006], p = 0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95\% CI] = -0.13 [-0.021 to -0.005], p = 0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between the MS patients and controls. Interpretation: Although both {$\beta$}-amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive aging and AD, cortical {$\beta$}-amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age-matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the accumulation of {$\beta$}-amyloid but not the accumulation of tau.

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

In this study, longitudinal relaxation time of blood in the sagittal sinus was measured at 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. A nonselective inversion pulse preceding a Look-Locker echo planar imaging sequence was performed to obtain the inversion recovery curve of venous blood. The results showed that longitudinal relaxation time of blood at 7 T was {$\sim$} 2.1 s which translates to an anticipated 33\% gain in the signal-to-noise ratio in arterial spin labeling experiments due to T1 relaxation alone compared with 3 T. In addition, the linear relationship between longitudinal relaxation time of blood and B0 was confirmed. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI is a non-invasive technique for the quantification of cerebral perfusion, and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) has been recommended as the standard implementation by a recent consensus of the community. Due to the low spatial resolution of ASL images, perfusion quantification is biased by partial volume effects. Consequently, several partial volume correction (PVEc) methods have been developed to reduce the bias in gray matter (GM) perfusion quantification. The efficacy of these methods relies on both the quality of the ASL data and the accuracy of partial volume estimates. Here we systematically investigate the sensitivity of different PVEc methods to variability in both the ASL data and partial volume estimates using simulated PCASL data and in vivo PCASL data from a reproducibility study. We examined the PVEc methods in two ways: the ability to preserve spatial details and the accuracy of GM perfusion estimation. Judging by the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between simulated and estimated GM CBF, the spatially regularized method was superior in preserving spatial details compared to the linear regression method (RMSE of 1.2 vs 5.1 in simulation of GM CBF with short scale spatial variations). The linear regression method was generally less sensitive than the spatially regularized method to noise in data and errors in the partial volume estimates (RMSE 6.3 vs 23.4 for SNR = 5 simulated data), but this could be attributed to the greater smoothing introduced by the method. Analysis of a healthy cohort dataset indicates that PVEc, using either method, improves the repeatability of perfusion quantification (within-subject coefficient of variation reduced by 5\% after PVEc).},

Previous literatures have reviewed the state of vessel segmentation methods from various perspectives. However, their reviews did not take the modern machine-learning methods especially deep neural networks into account. In this paper, we reviewed the state-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods by dividing them into two categories, rule-based, and machine-learning-based methods. The rule-based methods discriminate vessel structure from background relying on intuitively and exquisitely designed rule sets, while the machine-learning-based methods carry out the segmentation by self-learned rules from the previous experience. Instead of exhaustively listing all vessel segmentation methods, this paper focuses on the well-known blood vessel segmentation methods in recent years, to give readers a glimpse of the current state and future direction of segmentation technique for blood vessels.},
